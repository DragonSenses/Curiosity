# Events: change, input, cut, copy, paste

Let's cover various events that accompany data updates.

---

## Summary

Data change events:

| Event | Description | Specials |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `change`| A value was changed. | For text inputs triggers on focus loss. |
| `input` | For text inputs on every change. | Triggers immediately unlike `change`. |
| `cut/copy/paste` | Cut/copy/paste actions. | The action can be prevented. The `event.clipboardData` property gives access to the clipboard. All browsers except Firefox also support `navigator.clipboard`. |

## Event: change

The `change` event triggers when the element has finished changing.

For text inputs that means that the event occurs when it loses focus.

For instance, while we are typing in the text field below -- there's no event. But when we move the focus somewhere else, for instance, click on a button -- there will be a `change` event:

```html autorun height=40 run
<input type="text" onchange="alert(this.value)">
<input type="button" value="Button">
```

For other elements: `select`, `input type=checkbox/radio` it triggers right after the selection changes:

```html autorun height=40 run
<select onchange="alert(this.value)">
  <option value="">Select something</option>
  <option value="1">Option 1</option>
  <option value="2">Option 2</option>
  <option value="3">Option 3</option>
</select>
```


## Event: input

The `input` event triggers every time after a value is modified by the user.

Unlike keyboard events, it triggers on any value change, even those that does not involve keyboard actions: pasting with a mouse or using speech recognition to dictate the text.

For instance:

```html autorun height=40 run
<input type="text" id="input"> oninput: <span id="result"></span>
<script>
  input.oninput = function() {
    result.innerHTML = input.value;
  };
</script>
```

If we want to handle every modification of an `<input>` then this event is the best choice.

On the other hand, `input` event doesn't trigger on keyboard input and other actions that do not involve value change, e.g. pressing arrow keys `key:⇦` `key:⇨` while in the input.
