# Summary | WebSocket

WebSocket is a modern way to have persistent browser-server connections.

- WebSockets don't have cross-origin limitations.
- They are well-supported in browsers.
- Can send/receive strings and binary data.

The API is simple.

Methods:
- `socket.send(data)`,
- `socket.close([code], [reason])`.

Events:
- `open`,
- `message`,
- `error`,
- `close`.

WebSocket by itself does not include reconnection, authentication and many other high-level mechanisms. So there are client/server libraries for that, and it's also possible to implement these capabilities manually.

Sometimes, to integrate WebSocket into existing projects, people run a WebSocket server in parallel with the main HTTP-server, and they share a single database. Requests to WebSocket use `wss://ws.site.com`, a subdomain that leads to the WebSocket server, while `https://site.com` goes to the main HTTP-server.

Surely, other ways of integration are also possible.

# WebSocket

The `WebSocket` protocol, described in the specification [RFC 6455](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455), provides a way to exchange data between browser and server via a persistent connection. The data can be passed in both directions as "packets", without breaking the connection and the need of additional HTTP-requests.

WebSocket is especially great for services that require continuous data exchange, e.g. online games, real-time trading systems and so on.
