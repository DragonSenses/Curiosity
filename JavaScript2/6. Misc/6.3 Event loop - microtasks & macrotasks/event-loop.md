# Event loop: microtasks and macrotasks

Browser JavaScript execution flow, as well as in Node.js, is based on an *event loop*.

Understanding how event loop works is important for optimizations, and sometimes for the right architecture.

In this chapter we first cover theoretical details about how things work, and then see practical applications of that knowledge.

## Summary

A more detailed event loop algorithm (though still simplified compared to the [specification](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#event-loop-processing-model)):

1. Dequeue and run the oldest task from the *macrotask* queue (e.g. "script").
2. Execute all *microtasks*:
    - While the microtask queue is not empty:
        - Dequeue and run the oldest microtask.
3. Render changes if any.
4. If the macrotask queue is empty, wait till a macrotask appears.
5. Go to step 1.

To schedule a new *macrotask*:
- Use zero delayed `setTimeout(f)`.

That may be used to split a big calculation-heavy task into pieces, for the browser to be able to react to user events and show progress between them.

Also, used in event handlers to schedule an action after the event is fully handled (bubbling done).

To schedule a new *microtask*
- Use `queueMicrotask(f)`.
- Also promise handlers go through the microtask queue.

There's no UI or network event handling between microtasks: they run immediately one after another.

So one may want to `queueMicrotask` to execute a function asynchronously, but within the environment state.

### Web Workers

For long heavy calculations that shouldn't block the event loop, we can use [Web Workers](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html).

That's a way to run code in another, parallel thread.

Web Workers can exchange messages with the main process, but they have their own variables, and their own event loop.

Web Workers do not have access to DOM, so they are useful, mainly, for calculations, to use multiple CPU cores simultaneously.
