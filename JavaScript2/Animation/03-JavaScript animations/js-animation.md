# Summary | JavaScript Animations

For animations that CSS can't handle well, or those that need tight control, JavaScript can help. JavaScript animations should be implemented via `requestAnimationFrame`. That built-in method allows to setup a callback function to run when the browser will be preparing a repaint. Usually that's very soon, but the exact time depends on the browser.

When a page is in the background, there are no repaints at all, so the callback won't run: the animation will be suspended and won't consume resources. That's great.

Here's the helper `animate` function to setup most animations:

```js
function animate({timing, draw, duration}) {

  let start = performance.now();

  requestAnimationFrame(function animate(time) {
    // timeFraction goes from 0 to 1
    let timeFraction = (time - start) / duration;
    if (timeFraction > 1) timeFraction = 1;

    // calculate the current animation state
    let progress = timing(timeFraction);

    draw(progress); // draw it

    if (timeFraction < 1) {
      requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    }

  });
}
```

Options:

- `duration` -- the total animation time in ms.
- `timing` -- the function to calculate animation progress. Gets a time fraction from 0 to 1, returns the animation progress, usually from 0 to 1.
- `draw` -- the function to draw the animation.

Surely we could improve it, add more bells and whistles, but JavaScript animations are not applied on a daily basis. They are used to do something interesting and non-standard. So you'd want to add the features that you need when you need them.

JavaScript animations can use any timing function. We covered a lot of examples and transformations to make them even more versatile. Unlike CSS, we are not limited to Bezier curves here.

The same is about `draw`: we can animate anything, not just CSS properties.

# JavaScript animations

JavaScript animations can handle things that CSS can't.

For instance, moving along a complex path, with a timing function different from Bezier curves, or an animation on a canvas.

## Using setInterval

An animation can be implemented as a sequence of frames -- usually small changes to HTML/CSS properties.

For instance, changing `style.left` from `0px` to `100px` moves the element. And if we increase it in `setInterval`, changing by `2px` with a tiny delay, like 50 times per second, then it looks smooth. That's the same principle as in the cinema: 24 frames per second is enough to make it look smooth.

The pseudo-code can look like this:

```js
let timer = setInterval(function() {
  if (animation complete) clearInterval(timer);
  else increase style.left by 2px
}, 20); // change by 2px every 20ms, about 50 frames per second
```

More complete example of the animation:

```js
let start = Date.now(); // remember start time

let timer = setInterval(function() {
  // how much time passed from the start?
  let timePassed = Date.now() - start;

  if (timePassed >= 2000) {
    clearInterval(timer); // finish the animation after 2 seconds
    return;
  }

  // draw the animation at the moment timePassed
  draw(timePassed);

}, 20);

// as timePassed goes from 0 to 2000
// left gets values from 0px to 400px
function draw(timePassed) {
  train.style.left = timePassed / 5 + 'px';
}
```
