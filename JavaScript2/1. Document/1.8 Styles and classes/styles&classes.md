# Styles and classes

Before we get into JavaScript's ways of dealing with styles and classes -- here's an important rule. Hopefully it's obvious enough, but we still have to mention it.

There are generally two ways to style an element:

1. Create a class in CSS and add it: `<div class="...">`
2. Write properties directly into `style`: `<div style="...">`.

JavaScript can modify both classes and `style` properties.

We should always prefer CSS classes to `style`. The latter should only be used if classes "can't handle it".

For example, `style` is acceptable if we calculate coordinates of an element dynamically and want to set them from JavaScript, like this:

```js
let top = /* complex calculations */;
let left = /* complex calculations */;

elem.style.left = left; // e.g '123px', calculated at run-time
elem.style.top = top; // e.g '456px'
```

For other cases, like making the text red, adding a background icon -- describe that in CSS and then add the class (JavaScript can do that). That's more flexible and easier to support.

## ***Summary***

To manage classes, there are two DOM properties:

- `className` -- the string value, good to manage the whole set of classes.
- `classList` -- the object with methods `add/remove/toggle/contains`, good for individual classes.

To change the styles:

- The `style` property is an object with camelCased styles. Reading and writing to it has the same meaning as modifying individual properties in the `"style"` attribute. To see how to apply `important` and other rare stuff -- there's a list of methods at [MDN](mdn:api/CSSStyleDeclaration).

- The `style.cssText` property corresponds to the whole `"style"` attribute, the full string of styles.

To read the resolved styles (with respect to all classes, after all CSS is applied and final values are calculated):

## **className and classList**

Changing a class is one of the most often used actions in scripts.

In the ancient time, there was a limitation in JavaScript: a reserved word like `"class"` could not be an object property. That limitation does not exist now, but at that time it was impossible to have a `"class"` property, like `elem.class`.

So for classes the similar-looking property `"className"` was introduced: the `elem.className` corresponds to the `"class"` attribute.

For instance:

```html run
<body class="main page">
  <script>
    alert(document.body.className); // main page
  </script>
</body>
```

If we assign something to `elem.className`, it replaces the whole string of classes. Sometimes that's what we need, but often we want to add/remove a single class.

There's another property for that: `elem.classList`.

The `elem.classList` is a special object with methods to `add/remove/toggle` a single class.

For instance:

```html run
<body class="main page">
  <script>
    // add a class
    document.body.classList.add('article');

    alert(document.body.className); // main page article
  </script>
</body>
```

So we can operate both on the full class string using `className` or on individual classes using `classList`. What we choose depends on our needs.

Methods of `classList`:

- `elem.classList.add/remove("class")` -- adds/removes the class.
- `elem.classList.toggle("class")` -- adds the class if it doesn't exist, otherwise removes it.
- `elem.classList.contains("class")` -- checks for the given class, returns `true/false`.

Besides, `classList` is iterable, so we can list all classes with `for..of`, like this:

```html run
<body class="main page">
  <script>
    for (let name of document.body.classList) {
      alert(name); // main, and then page
    }
  </script>
</body>
```

## Element style

The property `elem.style` is an object that corresponds to what's written in the `"style"` attribute. Setting `elem.style.width="100px"` works the same as if we had in the attribute `style` a string `width:100px`.

For multi-word property the camelCase is used:

```js no-beautify
background-color  => elem.style.backgroundColor
z-index           => elem.style.zIndex
border-left-width => elem.style.borderLeftWidth
```

For instance:

```js run
document.body.style.backgroundColor = prompt('background color?', 'green');
```

### Prefixed properties
Browser-prefixed properties like `-moz-border-radius`, `-webkit-border-radius` also follow the same rule: a dash means upper case.

For instance:

```js
button.style.MozBorderRadius = '5px';
button.style.WebkitBorderRadius = '5px';
```
