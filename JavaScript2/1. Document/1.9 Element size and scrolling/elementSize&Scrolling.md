# Element size and scrolling

There are many JavaScript properties that allow us to read information about element width, height and other geometry features.

We often need them when moving or positioning elements in JavaScript.

## Summary

Elements have the following geometry properties:

- `offsetParent` -- is the nearest positioned ancestor or `td`, `th`, `table`, `body`.
- `offsetLeft/offsetTop` -- coordinates relative to the upper-left edge of `offsetParent`.
- `offsetWidth/offsetHeight` -- "outer" width/height of an element including borders.
- `clientLeft/clientTop` -- the distances from the upper-left outer corner to the upper-left inner (content + padding) corner. For left-to-right OS they are always the widths of left/top borders. For right-to-left OS the vertical scrollbar is on the left so `clientLeft` includes its width too.
- `clientWidth/clientHeight` -- the width/height of the content including paddings, but without the scrollbar.
- `scrollWidth/scrollHeight` -- the width/height of the content, just like `clientWidth/clientHeight`, but also include scrolled-out, invisible part of the element.
- `scrollLeft/scrollTop` -- width/height of the scrolled out upper part of the element, starting from its upper-left corner.

All properties are read-only except `scrollLeft/scrollTop` that make the browser scroll the element if changed.

## Sample element

As a sample element to demonstrate properties we'll use the one given below:

```html no-beautify
<div id="example">
  ...Text...
</div>
<style>
  #example {
    width: 300px;
    height: 200px;
    border: 25px solid #E8C48F;
    padding: 20px;
    overflow: auto;
  }
</style>
```

It has the border, padding and scrolling. The full set of features. There are no margins, as they are not the part of the element itself, and there are no special properties for them.

The element looks like this: ![](img/metric-css.svg)

### Mind the scrollbar

The picture above demonstrates the most complex case when the element has a scrollbar. Some browsers (not all) reserve the space for it by taking it from the content (labeled as "content width" above).

So, without scrollbar the content width would be `300px`, but if the scrollbar is `16px` wide (the width may vary between devices and browsers) then only `300 - 16 = 284px` remains, and we should take it into account. That's why examples from this chapter assume that there's a scrollbar. Without it, some calculations are simpler.

### The `padding-bottom` area may be filled with text

Usually paddings are shown empty on our illustrations, but if there's a lot of text in the element and it overflows, then browsers show the "overflowing" text at `padding-bottom`, that's normal.
