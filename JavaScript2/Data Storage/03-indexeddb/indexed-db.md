# Summary | IndexedDB

IndexedDB can be thought of as a "localStorage on steroids". It's a simple key-value database, powerful enough for offline apps, yet simple to use.

The best manual is the specification, [the current one](https://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB-2/) is 2.0, but few methods from [3.0](https://w3c.github.io/IndexedDB/) (it's not much different) are partially supported.

The basic usage can be described with a few phrases:

1. Get a promise wrapper like [idb](https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb).
2. Open a database: `idb.openDb(name, version, onupgradeneeded)`
    - Create object storages and indexes in `onupgradeneeded` handler or perform version update if needed.
3. For requests:
    - Create transaction `db.transaction('books')` (readwrite if needed).
    - Get the object store `transaction.objectStore('books')`.
4. Then, to search by a key, call methods on the object store directly.
    - To search by an object field, create an index.
5. If the data does not fit in memory, use a cursor.

# IndexedDB

IndexedDB is a database that is built into a browser, much more powerful than `localStorage`.

- Stores almost any kind of values by keys, multiple key types.
- Supports transactions for reliability.
- Supports key range queries, indexes.
- Can store much bigger volumes of data than `localStorage`.

That power is usually excessive for traditional client-server apps. IndexedDB is intended for offline apps, to be combined with ServiceWorkers and other technologies.

The native interface to IndexedDB, described in the specification <https://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB>, is event-based.

We can also use `async/await` with the help of a promise-based wrapper, like <https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb>. That's pretty convenient, but the wrapper is not perfect, it can't replace events for all cases. So we'll start with events, and then, after we gain an understanding of IndexedDb, we'll use the wrapper.

```smart header="Where's the data?"
Technically, the data is usually stored in the visitor's home directory, along with browser settings, extensions, etc.

Different browsers and OS-level users have each their own independant storage.
```

## Open database

To start working with IndexedDB, we first need to `open` (connect to) a database.

The syntax:

```js
let openRequest = indexedDB.open(name, version);
```

- `name` -- a string, the database name.
- `version` -- a positive integer version, by default `1` (explained below).

We can have many databases with different names, but all of them exist within the current origin (domain/protocol/port). Different websites can't access each other's databases.

The call returns `openRequest` object, we should listen to events on it:
- `success`: database is ready, there's the "database object" in `openRequest.result`, we should use it for further calls.
- `error`: opening failed.
- `upgradeneeded`: database is ready, but its version is outdated (see below).

**IndexedDB has a built-in mechanism of "schema versioning", absent in server-side databases.**

Unlike server-side databases, IndexedDB is client-side, the data is stored in the browser, so we, developers, don't have full-time access to it. So, when we have published a new version of our app, and the user visits our webpage, we may need to update the database.

If the local database version is less than specified in `open`, then a special event `upgradeneeded` is triggered, and we can compare versions and upgrade data structures as needed.

The `upgradeneeded` event also triggers when the database doesn't yet exist (technically, its version is `0`), so we can perform the initialization.

Let's say we published the first version of our app.

Then we can open the database with version `1` and perform the initialization in an `upgradeneeded` handler like this:

```js
let openRequest = indexedDB.open("store", *!*1*/!*);

openRequest.onupgradeneeded = function() {
  // triggers if the client had no database
  // ...perform initialization...
};

openRequest.onerror = function() {
  console.error("Error", openRequest.error);
};

openRequest.onsuccess = function() {
  let db = openRequest.result;
  // continue working with database using db object
};
```

Then, later, we publish the 2nd version.

We can open it with version `2` and perform the upgrade like this:

```js
let openRequest = indexedDB.open("store", *!*2*/!*);

openRequest.onupgradeneeded = function(event) {
  // the existing database version is less than 2 (or it doesn't exist)
  let db = openRequest.result;
  switch(event.oldVersion) { // existing db version
    case 0:
      // version 0 means that the client had no database
      // perform initialization
    case 1:
      // client had version 1
      // update
  }
};
```

Please note: as our current version is `2`, the `onupgradeneeded` handler has a code branch for version `0`, suitable for users that are accessing for the first time and have no database, and also for version `1`, for upgrades.

And then, only if `onupgradeneeded` handler finishes without errors, `openRequest.onsuccess` triggers, and the database is considered successfully opened.

To delete a database:

```js
let deleteRequest = indexedDB.deleteDatabase(name)
// deleteRequest.onsuccess/onerror tracks the result
```

### **We canâ€™t open a database using an older open call version**

If the current user database has a higher version than in the `open` call, e.g. the existing DB version is `3`, and we try to `open(...2)`, then that's an error, `openRequest.onerror` triggers.

That's rare, but such a thing may happen when a visitor loads outdated JavaScript code, e.g. from a proxy cache. So the code is old, but his database is new.

To protect from errors, we should check `db.version` and suggest a page reload. Use proper HTTP caching headers to avoid loading the old code, so that you'll never have such problems.

### Parallel update problem

As we're talking about versioning, let's tackle a small related problem.

Let's say:
1. A visitor opened our site in a browser tab, with database version `1`.
2. Then we rolled out an update, so our code is newer.
3. And then the same visitor opens our site in another tab.

So there's a tab with an open connection to DB version `1`, while the second one attempts to update it to version `2` in its `upgradeneeded` handler.

The problem is that a database is shared between two tabs, as it's the same site, same origin. And it can't be both version `1` and `2`. To perform the update to version `2`, all connections to version 1 must be closed, including the one in the first tab.

In order to organize that, the `versionchange` event triggers on the "outdated" database object. We should listen for it and close the old database connection (and probably suggest a page reload, to load the updated code).

If we don't listen for the `versionchange` event and don't close the old connection, then the second, new connection won't be made. The `openRequest` object will emit the `blocked` event instead of `success`. So the second tab won't work.

Here's the code to correctly handle the parallel upgrade. It installs the `onversionchange` handler, that triggers if the current database connection becomes outdated (db version is updated elsewhere) and closes the connection.

```js
let openRequest = indexedDB.open("store", 2);

openRequest.onupgradeneeded = ...;
openRequest.onerror = ...;

openRequest.onsuccess = function() {
  let db = openRequest.result;

  db.onversionchange = function() {
    db.close();
    alert("Database is outdated, please reload the page.")
  };

  // ...the db is ready, use it...
};

openRequest.onblocked = function() {
  // this event shouldn't trigger if we handle onversionchange correctly

  // it means that there's another open connection to the same database
  // and it wasn't closed after db.onversionchange triggered for it
};
```

...In other words, here we do two things:

1. The `db.onversionchange` listener informs us about a parallel update attempt, if the current database version becomes outdated.
2. The `openRequest.onblocked` listener informs us about the opposite situation: there's a connection to an outdated version elsewhere, and it doesn't close, so the newer connection can't be made.

We can handle things more gracefully in `db.onversionchange`, prompt the visitor to save the data before the connection is closed and so on. 

Or, an alternative approach would be to not close the database in `db.onversionchange`, but instead use the `onblocked` handler (in the new tab) to alert the visitor, tell him that the newer version can't be loaded until they close other tabs.

These update collisions happen rarely, but we should at least have some handling for them, at least an `onblocked` handler, to prevent our script from dying silently.
