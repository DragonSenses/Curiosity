# Summary | IndexedDB

IndexedDB can be thought of as a "localStorage on steroids". It's a simple key-value database, powerful enough for offline apps, yet simple to use.

The best manual is the specification, [the current one](https://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB-2/) is 2.0, but few methods from [3.0](https://w3c.github.io/IndexedDB/) (it's not much different) are partially supported.

The basic usage can be described with a few phrases:

1. Get a promise wrapper like [idb](https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb).
2. Open a database: `idb.openDb(name, version, onupgradeneeded)`
    - Create object storages and indexes in `onupgradeneeded` handler or perform version update if needed.
3. For requests:
    - Create transaction `db.transaction('books')` (readwrite if needed).
    - Get the object store `transaction.objectStore('books')`.
4. Then, to search by a key, call methods on the object store directly.
    - To search by an object field, create an index.
5. If the data does not fit in memory, use a cursor.

# IndexedDB

IndexedDB is a database that is built into a browser, much more powerful than `localStorage`.

- Stores almost any kind of values by keys, multiple key types.
- Supports transactions for reliability.
- Supports key range queries, indexes.
- Can store much bigger volumes of data than `localStorage`.

That power is usually excessive for traditional client-server apps. IndexedDB is intended for offline apps, to be combined with ServiceWorkers and other technologies.

The native interface to IndexedDB, described in the specification <https://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB>, is event-based.

We can also use `async/await` with the help of a promise-based wrapper, like <https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb>. That's pretty convenient, but the wrapper is not perfect, it can't replace events for all cases. So we'll start with events, and then, after we gain an understanding of IndexedDb, we'll use the wrapper.

```smart header="Where's the data?"
Technically, the data is usually stored in the visitor's home directory, along with browser settings, extensions, etc.

Different browsers and OS-level users have each their own independant storage.
```

## Open database

To start working with IndexedDB, we first need to `open` (connect to) a database.

The syntax:

```js
let openRequest = indexedDB.open(name, version);
```

- `name` -- a string, the database name.
- `version` -- a positive integer version, by default `1` (explained below).

We can have many databases with different names, but all of them exist within the current origin (domain/protocol/port). Different websites can't access each other's databases.

The call returns `openRequest` object, we should listen to events on it:
- `success`: database is ready, there's the "database object" in `openRequest.result`, we should use it for further calls.
- `error`: opening failed.
- `upgradeneeded`: database is ready, but its version is outdated (see below).

**IndexedDB has a built-in mechanism of "schema versioning", absent in server-side databases.**

Unlike server-side databases, IndexedDB is client-side, the data is stored in the browser, so we, developers, don't have full-time access to it. So, when we have published a new version of our app, and the user visits our webpage, we may need to update the database.

If the local database version is less than specified in `open`, then a special event `upgradeneeded` is triggered, and we can compare versions and upgrade data structures as needed.

The `upgradeneeded` event also triggers when the database doesn't yet exist (technically, its version is `0`), so we can perform the initialization.

Let's say we published the first version of our app.

Then we can open the database with version `1` and perform the initialization in an `upgradeneeded` handler like this:

```js
let openRequest = indexedDB.open("store", *!*1*/!*);

openRequest.onupgradeneeded = function() {
  // triggers if the client had no database
  // ...perform initialization...
};

openRequest.onerror = function() {
  console.error("Error", openRequest.error);
};

openRequest.onsuccess = function() {
  let db = openRequest.result;
  // continue working with database using db object
};
```

Then, later, we publish the 2nd version.

We can open it with version `2` and perform the upgrade like this:

```js
let openRequest = indexedDB.open("store", *!*2*/!*);

openRequest.onupgradeneeded = function(event) {
  // the existing database version is less than 2 (or it doesn't exist)
  let db = openRequest.result;
  switch(event.oldVersion) { // existing db version
    case 0:
      // version 0 means that the client had no database
      // perform initialization
    case 1:
      // client had version 1
      // update
  }
};
```

Please note: as our current version is `2`, the `onupgradeneeded` handler has a code branch for version `0`, suitable for users that are accessing for the first time and have no database, and also for version `1`, for upgrades.

And then, only if `onupgradeneeded` handler finishes without errors, `openRequest.onsuccess` triggers, and the database is considered successfully opened.

To delete a database:

```js
let deleteRequest = indexedDB.deleteDatabase(name)
// deleteRequest.onsuccess/onerror tracks the result
```

---

### **We canâ€™t open a database using an older open call version**

If the current user database has a higher version than in the `open` call, e.g. the existing DB version is `3`, and we try to `open(...2)`, then that's an error, `openRequest.onerror` triggers.

That's rare, but such a thing may happen when a visitor loads outdated JavaScript code, e.g. from a proxy cache. So the code is old, but his database is new.

To protect from errors, we should check `db.version` and suggest a page reload. Use proper HTTP caching headers to avoid loading the old code, so that you'll never have such problems.

---

### Parallel update problem

As we're talking about versioning, let's tackle a small related problem.

Let's say:
1. A visitor opened our site in a browser tab, with database version `1`.
2. Then we rolled out an update, so our code is newer.
3. And then the same visitor opens our site in another tab.

So there's a tab with an open connection to DB version `1`, while the second one attempts to update it to version `2` in its `upgradeneeded` handler.

The problem is that a database is shared between two tabs, as it's the same site, same origin. And it can't be both version `1` and `2`. To perform the update to version `2`, all connections to version 1 must be closed, including the one in the first tab.

In order to organize that, the `versionchange` event triggers on the "outdated" database object. We should listen for it and close the old database connection (and probably suggest a page reload, to load the updated code).

If we don't listen for the `versionchange` event and don't close the old connection, then the second, new connection won't be made. The `openRequest` object will emit the `blocked` event instead of `success`. So the second tab won't work.

Here's the code to correctly handle the parallel upgrade. It installs the `onversionchange` handler, that triggers if the current database connection becomes outdated (db version is updated elsewhere) and closes the connection.

```js
let openRequest = indexedDB.open("store", 2);

openRequest.onupgradeneeded = ...;
openRequest.onerror = ...;

openRequest.onsuccess = function() {
  let db = openRequest.result;

  db.onversionchange = function() {
    db.close();
    alert("Database is outdated, please reload the page.")
  };

  // ...the db is ready, use it...
};

openRequest.onblocked = function() {
  // this event shouldn't trigger if we handle onversionchange correctly

  // it means that there's another open connection to the same database
  // and it wasn't closed after db.onversionchange triggered for it
};
```

...In other words, here we do two things:

1. The `db.onversionchange` listener informs us about a parallel update attempt, if the current database version becomes outdated.
2. The `openRequest.onblocked` listener informs us about the opposite situation: there's a connection to an outdated version elsewhere, and it doesn't close, so the newer connection can't be made.

We can handle things more gracefully in `db.onversionchange`, prompt the visitor to save the data before the connection is closed and so on. 

Or, an alternative approach would be to not close the database in `db.onversionchange`, but instead use the `onblocked` handler (in the new tab) to alert the visitor, tell him that the newer version can't be loaded until they close other tabs.

These update collisions happen rarely, but we should at least have some handling for them, at least an `onblocked` handler, to prevent our script from dying silently.

## Object store

To store something in IndexedDB, we need an *object store*.

An object store is a core concept of IndexedDB. Counterparts in other databases are called "tables" or "collections". It's where the data is stored. A database may have multiple stores: one for users, another one for goods, etc.

Despite being named an "object store", primitives can be stored too.

**We can store almost any value, including complex objects.**

IndexedDB uses the [standard serialization algorithm](https://www.w3.org/TR/html53/infrastructure.html#section-structuredserializeforstorage) to clone-and-store an object. It's like `JSON.stringify`, but more powerful, capable of storing much more datatypes.

An example of an object that can't be stored: an object with circular references. Such objects are not serializable. `JSON.stringify` also fails for such objects.

**There must be a unique `key` for every value in the store.**     

A key must be one of these types - number, date, string, binary, or array. It's a unique identifier, so we can search/remove/update values by the key.

![](indexeddb-structure.svg)

As we'll see very soon, we can provide a key when we add a value to the store, similar to `localStorage`. But when we store objects, IndexedDB allows setting up an object property as the key, which is much more convenient. Or we can auto-generate keys.

But we need to create an object store first.

The syntax to create an object store:

```js
db.createObjectStore(name[, keyOptions]);
```

Please note, the operation is synchronous, no `await` needed.

- `name` is the store name, e.g. `"books"` for books,
- `keyOptions` is an optional object with one of two properties:
  - `keyPath` -- a path to an object property that IndexedDB will use as the key, e.g. `id`.
  - `autoIncrement` -- if `true`, then the key for a newly stored object is generated automatically, as an ever-incrementing number.

If we don't supply `keyOptions`, then we'll need to provide a key explicitly later, when storing an object.

For instance, this object store uses `id` property as the key:

```js
db.createObjectStore('books', {keyPath: 'id'});
```

**An object store can only be created/modified while updating the DB version, in `upgradeneeded` handler.**

That's a technical limitation. Outside of the handler we'll be able to add/remove/update the data, but object stores can only be created/removed/altered during a version update.

To perform a database version upgrade, there are two main approaches:

1. We can implement per-version upgrade functions: from 1 to 2, from 2 to 3, from 3 to 4 etc. Then, in `upgradeneeded` we can compare versions (e.g. old 2, now 4) and run per-version upgrades step by step, for every intermediate version (2 to 3, then 3 to 4).
2. Or we can just examine the database: get a list of existing object stores as `db.objectStoreNames`. That object is a [DOMStringList](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-dom-interfaces.html#domstringlist) that provides `contains(name)` method to check for existance. And then we can do updates depending on what exists and what doesn't.

For small databases the second variant may be simpler.

Here's the demo of the second approach:

```js
let openRequest = indexedDB.open("db", 2);

// create/upgrade the database without version checks
openRequest.onupgradeneeded = function() {
  let db = openRequest.result;
  if (!db.objectStoreNames.contains('books')) { // if there's no "books" store
    db.createObjectStore('books', {keyPath: 'id'}); // create it
  }
};
```

To delete an object store:

```js
db.deleteObjectStore('books')
```

## Transactions

The term "transaction" is generic, used in many kinds of databases.

A transaction is a group of operations, that should either all succeed or all fail.

For instance, when a person buys something, we need to:

1. Subtract the money from their account.
2. Add the item to their inventory.

It would be pretty bad if we complete the 1st operation, and then something goes wrong, e.g. lights out, and we fail to do the 2nd. Both should either succeed (purchase complete, good!) or both fail (at least the person kept their money, so they can retry).

Transactions can guarantee that.

**All data operations must be made within a transaction in IndexedDB.**

To start a transaction:

```js
db.transaction(store[, type]);
```

- `store` is a store name that the transaction is going to access, e.g. `"books"`. Can be an array of store names if we're going to access multiple stores.
- `type` â€“ a transaction type, one of:
  - `readonly` -- can only read, the default.
  - `readwrite` -- can only read and write the data, but not create/remove/alter object stores.

There's also `versionchange` transaction type: such transactions can do everything, but we can't create them manually. IndexedDB automatically creates a `versionchange` transaction when opening the database, for `upgradeneeded` handler. That's why it's a single place where we can update the database structure, create/remove object stores.

---

### Why are there different types of transactions?

Performance is the reason why transactions need to be labeled either `readonly` and `readwrite`.

Many `readonly` transactions are able to access the same store concurrently, but `readwrite` transactions can't. A `readwrite` transaction "locks" the store for writing. The next transaction must wait before the previous one finishes before accessing the same store.

---

After the transaction is created, we can add an item to the store, like this:

```js
let transaction = db.transaction("books", "readwrite"); // (1)

// get an object store to operate on it
let books = transaction.objectStore("books"); // (2)

let book = {
  id: 'js',
  price: 10,
  created: new Date()
};

let request = books.add(book); // (3)

request.onsuccess = function() { // (4)
  console.log("Book added to the store", request.result);
};

request.onerror = function() {
  console.log("Error", request.error);
};
```

There were basically four steps:

1. Create a transaction, mentioning all the stores it's going to access, at `(1)`.
2. Get the store object using `transaction.objectStore(name)`, at `(2)`.
3. Perform the request to the object store `books.add(book)`, at `(3)`.
4. ...Handle request success/error `(4)`, then we can make other requests if needed, etc.

Object stores support two methods to store a value:

- **put(value, [key])**
    Add the `value` to the store. The `key` is supplied only if the object store did not have `keyPath` or `autoIncrement` option. If there's already a value with the same key, it will be replaced.

- **add(value, [key])**
    Same as `put`, but if there's already a value with the same key, then the request fails, and an error with the name `"ConstraintError"` is generated.

Similar to opening a database, we can send a request: `books.add(book)`, and then wait for `success/error` events.

- The `request.result` for `add` is the key of the new object.
- The error is in `request.error` (if any).

---

## Transactions' autocommit

In the example above we started the transaction and made `add` request. But as we stated previously, a transaction may have multiple associated requests, that must either all succeed or all fail. How do we mark the transaction as finished, with no more requests to come?

The short answer is: we don't.

In the next version 3.0 of the specification, there will probably be a manual way to finish the transaction, but right now in 2.0 there isn't.

**When all transaction requests are finished, and the [microtasks queue](info:microtask-queue) is empty, it is committed automatically.**

Usually, we can assume that a transaction commits when all its requests are complete, and the current code finishes.

So, in the example above no special call is needed to finish the transaction.

Transactions auto-commit principle has an important side effect. We can't insert an async operation like `fetch`, `setTimeout` in the middle of a transaction. IndexedDB will not keep the transaction waiting till these are done.

In the code below, `request2` in the line `(*)` fails, because the transaction is already committed, and can't make any request in it:

```js
let request1 = books.add(book);

request1.onsuccess = function() {
  fetch('/').then(response => {
*!*
    let request2 = books.add(anotherBook); // (*)
*/!*
    request2.onerror = function() {
      console.log(request2.error.name); // TransactionInactiveError
    };
  });
};
```

That's because `fetch` is an asynchronous operation, a macrotask. Transactions are closed before the browser starts doing macrotasks.

Authors of IndexedDB spec believe that transactions should be short-lived. Mostly for performance reasons.

Notably, `readwrite` transactions "lock" the stores for writing. So if one part of the application initiated `readwrite` on `books` object store, then another part that wants to do the same has to wait: the new transaction "hangs" till the first one is done. That can lead to strange delays if transactions take a long time.
