# Summary | LocalStorage, sessionStorage

Web storage objects `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` allow to store key/value pairs in the browser.

- Both `key` and `value` must be strings.
- The limit is 5mb+, depends on the browser.
- They do not expire.
- The data is bound to the origin (domain/port/protocol).

| `localStorage` | `sessionStorage` |
|----------------|------------------|
| Shared between all tabs and windows with the same origin | Visible within a browser tab, including iframes from the same origin |
| Survives browser restart | Survives page refresh (but not tab close) |

API:

- `setItem(key, value)` -- store key/value pair.
- `getItem(key)` -- get the value by key.
- `removeItem(key)` -- remove the key with its value.
- `clear()` -- delete everything.
- `key(index)` -- get the key number `index`.
- `length` -- the number of stored items.
- Use `Object.keys` to get all keys.
- We access keys as object properties, in that case `storage` event isn't triggered.

Storage event:

- Triggers on `setItem`, `removeItem`, `clear` calls.
- Contains all the data about the operation (`key/oldValue/newValue`), the document `url` and the storage object `storageArea`.
- Triggers on all `window` objects that have access to the storage except the one that generated it (within a tab for `sessionStorage`, globally for `localStorage`).
