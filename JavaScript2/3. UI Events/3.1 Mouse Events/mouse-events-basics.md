# Mouse events

In this chapter we'll get into more details about mouse events and their properties.

Please note: such events may come not only from "mouse devices", but are also from other devices, such as phones and tablets, where they are emulated for compatibility.

## Summary

Mouse events have the following properties:

- Button: `button`.
- Modifier keys (`true` if pressed): `altKey`, `ctrlKey`, `shiftKey` and `metaKey` (Mac).
  - If you want to handle `key:Ctrl`, then don't forget Mac users, they usually use `key:Cmd`, so it's better to check `if (e.metaKey || e.ctrlKey)`.

- Window-relative coordinates: `clientX/clientY`.
- Document-relative coordinates: `pageX/pageY`.

The default browser action of `mousedown` is text selection, if it's not good for the interface, then it should be prevented.

## Mouse event types

We've already seen some of these events:

`mousedown/mouseup`
: Mouse button is clicked/released over an element.

`mouseover/mouseout`
: Mouse pointer comes over/out from an element.

`mousemove`
: Every mouse move over an element triggers that event.

`click`
: Triggers after `mousedown` and then `mouseup` over the same element if the left mouse button was used.

`dblclick`
: Triggers after two clicks on the same element within a short timeframe. Rarely used nowadays.

`contextmenu`
: Triggers when the right mouse button is pressed. There are other ways to open a context menu, e.g. using a special keyboard key, it triggers in that case also, so it's not exactly the mouse event.

...There are several other events too, we'll cover them later.

## Events order

As you can see from the list above, a user action may trigger multiple events.

For instance, a left-button click first triggers `mousedown`, when the button is pressed, then `mouseup` and `click` when it's released.

In cases when a single action initiates multiple events, their order is fixed. That is, the handlers are called in the order `mousedown` -> `mouseup` -> `click`.

Click the button below and you'll see the events. Try double-click too.

On the teststand below, all mouse events are logged, and if there is more than a 1 second delay between them, they are separated by a horizontal rule.

Also, we can see the `button` property that allows us to detect the mouse button; it's explained below.

```js
<input onmousedown="return logMouse(event)" onmouseup="return logMouse(event)" onclick="return logMouse(event)" oncontextmenu="return logMouse(event)" ondblclick="return logMouse(event)" value="Click me with the right or the left mouse button" type="button"> <input onclick="logClear('test')" value="Clear" type="button"> <form id="testform" name="testform"> <textarea style="font-size:12px;height:150px;width:360px;"></textarea></form>
```

## Mouse button

Click-related events always have the `button` property, which allows to get the exact mouse button.

We usually don't use it for `click` and `contextmenu` events, because the former happens only on left-click, and the latter -- only on right-click.

On the other hand, `mousedown` and `mouseup` handlers may need `event.button`, because these events trigger on any button, so `button` allows to distinguish between "right-mousedown" and "left-mousedown".

The possible values of `event.button` are:

| Button state | `event.button` |
|--------------|----------------|
| Left button (primary) | 0 |
| Middle button (auxiliary) | 1 |
| Right button (secondary) | 2 |
| X1 button (back) | 3 |
| X2 button (forward) | 4 |

Most mouse devices only have the left and right buttons, so possible values are `0` or `2`. Touch devices also generate similar events when one taps on them.

Also there's `event.buttons` property that has all currently pressed buttons as an integer, one bit per button. In practice this property is very rarely used, you can find details at [MDN](mdn:/api/MouseEvent/buttons) if you ever need it.

### The outdated `event.which`

Old code may use `event.which` property that's an old non-standard way of getting a button, with possible values:

- `event.which == 1` - left button,
- `event.which == 2` - middle button,
- `event.which == 3` - right button.

As of now, `event.which` is deprecated, we shouldn't use it.
