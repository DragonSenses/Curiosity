# Keyboard: keydown and keyup

Before we get to keyboard, please note that on modern devices there are other ways to "input something". For instance, people use speech recognition (especially on mobile devices) or copy/paste with the mouse.

So if we want to track any input into an `<input>` field, then keyboard events are not enough. There's another event named `input` to track changes of an `<input>` field, by any means. And it may be a better choice for such task. We'll cover it later in the chapter Events: change, input, cut, copy, paste in `events-change-input.md`

Keyboard events should be used when we want to handle keyboard actions (virtual keyboard also counts). For instance, to react on arrow keys `key:Up` and `key:Down` or hotkeys (including combinations of keys).

## Summary

Pressing a key always generates a keyboard event, be it symbol keys or special keys like `key:Shift` or `key:Ctrl` and so on. The only exception is `key:Fn` key that sometimes presents on a laptop keyboard. There's no keyboard event for it, because it's often implemented on lower level than OS.

Keyboard events:

- `keydown` -- on pressing the key (auto-repeats if the key is pressed for long),
- `keyup` -- on releasing the key.

Main keyboard event properties:

- `code` -- the "key code" (`"KeyA"`, `"ArrowLeft"` and so on), specific to the physical location of the key on keyboard.
- `key` -- the character (`"A"`, `"a"` and so on), for non-character keys, such as `key:Esc`, usually has the same value  as `code`.

In the past, keyboard events were sometimes used to track user input in form fields. That's not reliable, because the input can come from various sources. We have `input` and `change` events to handle any input (covered later in the chapter `events-change-input.md`). They trigger after any kind of input, including copy-pasting or speech recognition.

We should use keyboard events when we really want keyboard. For example, to react on hotkeys or special keys.

## Teststand

To better understand keyboard events, you can use the teststand in `testStand.html`

Try different key combinations in the text field.

## Keydown and keyup

The `keydown` events happens when a key is pressed down, and then `keyup` -- when it's released.

### event.code and event.key

The `key` property of the event object allows to get the character, while the `code` property of the event object allows to get the "physical key code".

For instance, the same key `key:Z` can be pressed with or without `key:Shift`. That gives us two different characters: lowercase `z` and uppercase `Z`.

The `event.key` is exactly the character, and it will be different. But `event.code` is the same:

| Key          | `event.key` | `event.code` |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| `key:Z`      |`z` (lowercase)         |`KeyZ`        |
| `key:Shift+Z`|`Z` (uppercase)          |`KeyZ`        |


If a user works with different languages, then switching to another language would make a totally different character instead of `"Z"`. That will become the value of `event.key`, while `event.code` is always the same: `"KeyZ"`.

### "KeyZ" and other key codes

Every key has the code that depends on its location on the keyboard. Key codes described in the [UI Events code specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-code/).

For instance:
- Letter keys have codes `"Key<letter>"`: `"KeyA"`, `"KeyB"` etc.
- Digit keys have codes: `"Digit<number>"`: `"Digit0"`, `"Digit1"` etc.
- Special keys are coded by their names: `"Enter"`, `"Backspace"`, `"Tab"` etc.

There are several widespread keyboard layouts, and the specification gives key codes for each of them.

Read the [alphanumeric section of the spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-code/#key-alphanumeric-section) for more codes, or just press a key in the testStand above.

### Case matters: `"KeyZ"`, not `"keyZ"`

Seems obvious, but people still make mistakes.

Please evade mistypes: it's `KeyZ`, not `keyZ`. The check like `event.code=="keyZ"` won't work: the first letter of `"Key"` must be ***uppercase***.
