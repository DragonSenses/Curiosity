# Moving the mouse: mouseover/out, mouseenter/leave

## Summary

We covered events `mouseover`, `mouseout`, `mousemove`, `mouseenter` and `mouseleave`.

These things are good to note:

- A fast mouse move may skip intermediate elements.
- Events `mouseover/out` and `mouseenter/leave` have an additional property: `relatedTarget`. That's the element that we are coming from/to, complementary to `target`.

Events `mouseover/out` trigger even when we go from the parent element to a child element. The browser assumes that the mouse can be only over one element at one time -- the deepest one.

Events `mouseenter/leave` are different in that aspect: they only trigger when the mouse comes in and out the element as a whole. Also they do not bubble.

Let's dive into more details about events that happen when the mouse moves between elements.

## Events mouseover/mouseout, relatedTarget

The `mouseover` event occurs when a mouse pointer comes over an element, and `mouseout` -- when it leaves.

These events are special, because they have property `relatedTarget`. This property complements `target`. When a mouse leaves one element for another, one of them becomes `target`, and the other one - `relatedTarget`.

For `mouseover`:

- `event.target` -- is the element where the mouse came over.
- `event.relatedTarget` -- is the element from which the mouse came (`relatedTarget` -> `target`).

For `mouseout` the reverse:

- `event.target` -- is the element that the mouse left.
- `event.relatedTarget` -- is the new under-the-pointer element, that mouse left for (`target` -> `relatedTarget`).

To see an example check out `smiley.html`, where each face and its features are separate elements. When you move the mouse, you can see mouse events in the text area.

Each event has the information about both `target` and `relatedTarget`.

### `relatedTarget` can be `null`

The `relatedTarget` property can be `null`.

That's normal and just means that the mouse came not from another element, but from out of the window. Or that it left the window.

We should keep that possibility in mind when using `event.relatedTarget` in our code. If we access `event.relatedTarget.tagName`, then there will be an error.

## Skipping elements

The `mousemove` event triggers when the mouse moves. But that doesn't mean that every pixel leads to an event.

The browser checks the mouse position from time to time. And if it notices changes then triggers the events.

That means that if the visitor is moving the mouse very fast then some DOM-elements may be skipped:

If the mouse moves very fast from `#FROM` to `#TO` elements as painted above, then intermediate `<div>` elements (or some of them) may be skipped. The `mouseout` event may trigger on `#FROM` and then immediately `mouseover` on `#TO`.

That's good for performance, because there may be many intermediate elements. We don't really want to process in and out of each one.

On the other hand, we should keep in mind that the mouse pointer doesn't "visit" all elements along the way. It can "jump".

In particular, it's possible that the pointer jumps right inside the middle of the page from out of the window. In that case `relatedTarget` is `null`, because it came from "nowhere":
