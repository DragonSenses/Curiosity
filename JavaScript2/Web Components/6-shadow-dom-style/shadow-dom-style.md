# Summary | Shadow DOM Styling

Shadow DOM can include styles, such as `<style>` or `<link rel="stylesheet">`.

Local styles can affect:
- shadow tree,
- shadow host with `:host` and `:host()` pseudoclasses,
- slotted elements (coming from light DOM), `::slotted(selector)` allows to select  slotted elements themselves, but not their children.

Document styles can affect:
- shadow host (as it lives in the outer document)
- slotted elements and their contents (as that's also in the outer document)

When CSS properties conflict, normally document styles have precedence, unless the property is labelled as `!important`. Then local styles have precedence.

CSS custom properties pierce through shadow DOM. They are used as "hooks" to style the component:

1. The component uses a custom CSS property to style key elements, such as `var(--component-name-title, <default value>)`.
2. Component author publishes these properties for developers, they are same important as other public component methods.
3. When a developer wants to style a title, they assign `--component-name-title` CSS property for the shadow host or above.

# Shadow DOM styling

Shadow DOM may include both `<style>` and `<link rel="stylesheet" href="…">` tags. In the latter case, stylesheets are HTTP-cached, so they are not redownloaded for multiple components that use same template.

As a general rule, local styles work only inside the shadow tree, and document styles work outside of it. But there are few exceptions.

## :host

The `:host` selector allows to select the shadow host (the element containing the shadow tree).

For instance, we're making `<custom-dialog>` element that should be centered. For that we need to style the `<custom-dialog>` element itself.

That's exactly what `:host` does:

```html run autorun="no-epub" untrusted height=80
<template id="tmpl">
  <style>
    /* the style will be applied from inside to the custom-dialog element */
    :host {
      position: fixed;
      left: 50%;
      top: 50%;
      transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
      display: inline-block;
      border: 1px solid red;
      padding: 10px;
    }
  </style>
  <slot></slot>
</template>

<script>
customElements.define('custom-dialog', class extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'}).append(tmpl.content.cloneNode(true));
  }
});
</script>

<custom-dialog>
  Hello!
</custom-dialog>
```

## Cascading

The shadow host (`<custom-dialog>` itself) resides in the light DOM, so it's affected by document CSS rules.

If there's a property styled both in `:host` locally, and in the document, then the document style takes precedence.

For instance, if in the document we had:
```html
<style>
custom-dialog {
  padding: 0;
}
</style>
```
...Then the `<custom-dialog>` would be without padding.

It's very convenient, as we can setup "default" component styles in its `:host` rule, and then easily override them in the document.

The exception is when a local property is labelled `!important`, for such properties, local styles take precedence.

## :host(selector)

Same as `:host`, but applied only if the shadow host matches the `selector`.

For example, we'd like to center the `<custom-dialog>` only if it has `centered` attribute:

```html run autorun="no-epub" untrusted height=80
<template id="tmpl">
  <style>

    :host([centered]) {

      position: fixed;
      left: 50%;
      top: 50%;
      transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
      border-color: blue;
    }

    :host {
      display: inline-block;
      border: 1px solid red;
      padding: 10px;
    }
  </style>
  <slot></slot>
</template>

<script>
customElements.define('custom-dialog', class extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'}).append(tmpl.content.cloneNode(true));
  }
});
</script>


<custom-dialog centered>
  Centered!
</custom-dialog>

<custom-dialog>
  Not centered.
</custom-dialog>
```

Now the additional centering styles are only applied to the first dialog: `<custom-dialog centered>`.

To summarize, we can use `:host`-family of selectors to style the main element of the component. These styles (unless `!important`) can be overridden by the document.

## Styling slotted content

Now let's consider the situation with slots.

Slotted elements come from light DOM, so they use document styles. Local styles do not affect slotted content.

In the example below, slotted `<span>` is bold, as per document style, but does not take `background` from the local style:

```html run autorun="no-epub" untrusted height=80
<style>

  span { font-weight: bold }

</style>

<user-card>
  <div slot="username"><span>John Smith</span></div>
</user-card>

<script>
customElements.define('user-card', class extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});
    this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
      <style>

      span { background: red; }

      </style>
      Name: <slot name="username"></slot>
    `;
  }
});
</script>
```

The result is bold, but not red.

If we'd like to style slotted elements in our component, there are two choices.

First, we can style the `<slot>` itself and rely on CSS inheritance:

```html run autorun="no-epub" untrusted height=80
<user-card>
  <div slot="username"><span>John Smith</span></div>
</user-card>

<script>
customElements.define('user-card', class extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});
    this.shadowRoot.innerHTML = `
      <style>

      slot[name="username"] { font-weight: bold; }

      </style>
      Name: <slot name="username"></slot>
    `;
  }
});
</script>
```
