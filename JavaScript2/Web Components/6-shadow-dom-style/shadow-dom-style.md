# Summary | Shadow DOM Styling

Shadow DOM can include styles, such as `<style>` or `<link rel="stylesheet">`.

Local styles can affect:
- shadow tree,
- shadow host with `:host` and `:host()` pseudoclasses,
- slotted elements (coming from light DOM), `::slotted(selector)` allows to select  slotted elements themselves, but not their children.

Document styles can affect:
- shadow host (as it lives in the outer document)
- slotted elements and their contents (as that's also in the outer document)

When CSS properties conflict, normally document styles have precedence, unless the property is labelled as `!important`. Then local styles have precedence.

CSS custom properties pierce through shadow DOM. They are used as "hooks" to style the component:

1. The component uses a custom CSS property to style key elements, such as `var(--component-name-title, <default value>)`.
2. Component author publishes these properties for developers, they are same important as other public component methods.
3. When a developer wants to style a title, they assign `--component-name-title` CSS property for the shadow host or above.

# Shadow DOM styling

Shadow DOM may include both `<style>` and `<link rel="stylesheet" href="â€¦">` tags. In the latter case, stylesheets are HTTP-cached, so they are not redownloaded for multiple components that use same template.

As a general rule, local styles work only inside the shadow tree, and document styles work outside of it. But there are few exceptions.

## :host

The `:host` selector allows to select the shadow host (the element containing the shadow tree).

For instance, we're making `<custom-dialog>` element that should be centered. For that we need to style the `<custom-dialog>` element itself.

That's exactly what `:host` does:

```html run autorun="no-epub" untrusted height=80
<template id="tmpl">
  <style>
    /* the style will be applied from inside to the custom-dialog element */
    :host {
      position: fixed;
      left: 50%;
      top: 50%;
      transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
      display: inline-block;
      border: 1px solid red;
      padding: 10px;
    }
  </style>
  <slot></slot>
</template>

<script>
customElements.define('custom-dialog', class extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'}).append(tmpl.content.cloneNode(true));
  }
});
</script>

<custom-dialog>
  Hello!
</custom-dialog>
```

## Cascading

The shadow host (`<custom-dialog>` itself) resides in the light DOM, so it's affected by document CSS rules.

If there's a property styled both in `:host` locally, and in the document, then the document style takes precedence.

For instance, if in the document we had:
```html
<style>
custom-dialog {
  padding: 0;
}
</style>
```
...Then the `<custom-dialog>` would be without padding.

It's very convenient, as we can setup "default" component styles in its `:host` rule, and then easily override them in the document.

The exception is when a local property is labelled `!important`, for such properties, local styles take precedence.
