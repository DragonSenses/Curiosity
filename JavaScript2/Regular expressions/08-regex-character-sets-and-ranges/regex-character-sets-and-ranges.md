# Sets and ranges [...]

Several characters or character classes inside square brackets `[…]` mean to "search for any character among given".

## Sets

For instance, `pattern:[eao]` means any of the 3 characters: `'a'`, `'e'`, or `'o'`.

That's called a *set*. Sets can be used in a regexp along with regular characters:

```js run
// find [t or m], and then "op"
console.log( "Mop top".match(/[tm]op/gi) ); // "Mop", "top"
```

Please note that although there are multiple characters in the set, they correspond to exactly one character in the match.

So the example below gives no matches:

```js run
// find "V", then [o or i], then "la"
console.log( "Voila".match(/V[oi]la/) ); // null, no matches
```

The pattern searches for:

- `pattern:V`,
- then *one* of the letters `pattern:[oi]`,
- then `pattern:la`.

So there would be a match for `match:Vola` or `match:Vila`.
