# Summary | Unicode: flag "u" and class \p{...}

Flag `pattern:u` enables the support of Unicode in regular expressions.

That means two things:

1. Characters of 4 bytes are handled correctly: as a single character, not two 2-byte characters.
2. Unicode properties can be used in the search: `\p{…}`.

With Unicode properties we can look for words in given languages, special characters (quotes, currencies) and so on.

# Unicode: flag "u" and class \p{...}

JavaScript uses [Unicode encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) for strings. Most characters are encoded with 2 bytes, but that allows to represent at most 65536 characters.

That range is not big enough to encode all possible characters, that's why some rare characters are encoded with 4 bytes, for instance like `𝒳` (mathematical X) or `😄` (a smile), some hieroglyphs and so on.

Here are the Unicode values of some characters:

| Character  | Unicode | Bytes count in Unicode  |
|------------|---------|--------|
| a | `0x0061` |  2 |
| ≈ | `0x2248` |  2 |
|𝒳| `0x1d4b3` | 4 |
|𝒴| `0x1d4b4` | 4 |
|😄| `0x1f604` | 4 |

So characters like `a` and `≈` occupy 2 bytes, while codes for `𝒳`, `𝒴` and `😄` are longer, they have 4 bytes.

Long time ago, when JavaScript language was created, Unicode encoding was simpler: there were no 4-byte characters. So, some language features still handle them incorrectly.

For instance, `length` thinks that here are two characters:

```js run
alert('😄'.length); // 2
alert('𝒳'.length); // 2
```

...But we can see that there's only one, right? The point is that `length` treats 4 bytes as two 2-byte characters. That's incorrect, because they must be considered only together (so-called "surrogate pair", see `Strings`).

By default, regular expressions also treat 4-byte "long characters" as a pair of 2-byte ones. And, as it happens with strings, that may lead to odd results. We'll see that a bit later, in `regex-character-sets-and-ranges`.

Unlike strings, regular expressions have flag `pattern:u` that fixes such problems. With such flag, a regexp handles 4-byte characters correctly. And also Unicode property search becomes available, we'll get to it next.
