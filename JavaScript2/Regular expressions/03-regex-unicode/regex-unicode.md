# Summary | Unicode: flag "u" and class \p{...}

Flag `pattern:u` enables the support of Unicode in regular expressions.

That means two things:

1. Characters of 4 bytes are handled correctly: as a single character, not two 2-byte characters.
2. Unicode properties can be used in the search: `\p{â€¦}`.

With Unicode properties we can look for words in given languages, special characters (quotes, currencies) and so on.
