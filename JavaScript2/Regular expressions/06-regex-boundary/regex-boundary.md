# Word boundary: \b

A word boundary `pattern:\b` is a test, just like `pattern:^` and `pattern:$`.

When the regexp engine (program module that implements searching for regexps) comes across `pattern:\b`, it checks that the position in the string is a word boundary.

There are three different positions that qualify as word boundaries:

- At string start, if the first string character is a word character `pattern:\w`.
- Between two characters in the string, where one is a word character `pattern:\w` and the other is not.
- At string end, if the last string character is a word character `pattern:\w`.

For instance, regexp `pattern:\bJava\b` will be found in `subject:Hello, Java!`, where `subject:Java` is a standalone word, but not in `subject:Hello, JavaScript!`.

```js run
alert( "Hello, Java!".match(/\bJava\b/) ); // Java
alert( "Hello, JavaScript!".match(/\bJava\b/) ); // null
```

In the string `subject:Hello, Java!` following positions correspond to `pattern:\b`:
