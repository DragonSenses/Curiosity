# Summary | Capturing Groups

Parentheses group together a part of the regular expression, so that the quantifier applies to it as a whole.

Parentheses groups are numbered left-to-right, and can optionally be named with  `(?<name>...)`.

The content, matched by a group, can be obtained in the results:

- The method `str.match` returns capturing groups only without flag `pattern:g`.
- The method `str.matchAll` always returns capturing groups.

If the parentheses have no name, then their contents is available in the match array by its number. Named parentheses are also available in the property `groups`.

We can also use parentheses contents in the replacement string in `str.replace`: by the number `$n` or the name `$<name>`.

A group may be excluded from numbering by adding `pattern:?:` in its start. That's used when we need to apply a quantifier to the whole group, but don't want it as a separate item in the results array. We also can't reference such parentheses in the replacement string.

# Capturing groups

A part of a pattern can be enclosed in parentheses `pattern:(...)`. This is called a "capturing group".

That has two effects:

1. It allows to get a part of the match as a separate item in the result array.
2. If we put a quantifier after the parentheses, it applies to the parentheses as a whole.
