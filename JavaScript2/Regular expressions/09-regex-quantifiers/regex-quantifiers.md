# Quantifiers +, *, ? and {n}

Let's say we have a string like `+7(903)-123-45-67` and want to find all numbers in it. But unlike before, we are interested not in single digits, but full numbers: `7, 903, 123, 45, 67`.

A number is a sequence of 1 or more digits `pattern:\d`. To mark how many we need, we can append a *quantifier*.
