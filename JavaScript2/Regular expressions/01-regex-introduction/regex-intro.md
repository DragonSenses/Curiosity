# Summary | Regular Expressions, Patterns & flags

- A regular expression consists of a pattern and optional flags: `pattern:g`, `pattern:i`, `pattern:m`, `pattern:u`, `pattern:s`, `pattern:y`.
- Without flags and special symbols  (that we'll study later), the search by a regexp is the same as a substring search.
- The method `str.match(regexp)` looks for matches: all of them if there's `pattern:g` flag, otherwise, only the first one.
- The method `str.replace(regexp, replacement)` replaces matches found using `regexp` with `replacement`: all of them if there's `pattern:g` flag, otherwise only the first one.
- The method `regexp.test(str)` returns `true` if there's at least one match, otherwise, it returns `false`.

# Patterns and flags

Regular expressions are patterns that provide a powerful way to search and replace in text.

In JavaScript, they are available via the [RegExp](mdn:js/RegExp) object, as well as being integrated in methods of strings.

## Regular Expressions

A regular expression (also "regexp", or just "reg") consists of a *pattern* and optional *flags*.

There are two syntaxes that can be used to create a regular expression object.

The "long" syntax:

```js
regexp = new RegExp("pattern", "flags");
```

And the "short" one, using slashes `"/"`:

```js
regexp = /pattern/; // no flags
regexp = /pattern/gmi; // with flags g,m and i (to be covered soon)
```

Slashes `pattern:/.../` tell JavaScript that we are creating a regular expression. They play the same role as quotes for strings.

In both cases `regexp` becomes an instance of the built-in `RegExp` class.

The main difference between these two syntaxes is that pattern using slashes `/.../` does not allow for expressions to be inserted (like string template literals with `${...}`). They are fully static.

Slashes are used when we know the regular expression at the code writing time -- and that's the most common situation. While `new RegExp` is more often used when we need to create a regexp "on the fly" from a dynamically generated string. For instance:

```js
let tag = prompt("What tag do you want to find?", "h2");

let regexp = new RegExp(`<${tag}>`); // same as /<h2>/ if answered "h2" in the prompt above
```

## Flags

Regular expressions may have flags that affect the search.

There are only 6 of them in JavaScript:

`pattern:i`
: With this flag the search is case-insensitive: no difference between `A` and `a` (see the example below).

`pattern:g`
: With this flag the search looks for all matches, without it -- only the first match is returned.

`pattern:m`
: Multiline mode (covered in the chapter <info:regexp-multiline-mode>).

`pattern:s`
: Enables "dotall" mode, that allows a dot `pattern:.` to match newline character `\n` (covered in the chapter <info:regexp-character-classes>).

`pattern:u`
: Enables full Unicode support. The flag enables correct processing of surrogate pairs. More about that in the chapter <info:regexp-unicode>.

`pattern:y`
: "Sticky" mode: searching at the exact position in the text  (covered in the chapter <info:regexp-sticky>)

### Colors

From here on the color scheme is:

- regexp -- `pattern:red`
- string (where we search) -- `subject:blue`
- result -- `match:green`
