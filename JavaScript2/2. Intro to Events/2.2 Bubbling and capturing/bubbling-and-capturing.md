# Bubbling and capturing

## Summary

When an event happens -- the most nested element where it happens gets labeled as the "target element" (`event.target`).

- Then the event moves down from the document root to `event.target`, calling handlers assigned with `addEventListener(..., true)` on the way (`true` is a shorthand for `{capture: true}`).
- Then handlers are called on the target element itself.
- Then the event bubbles up from `event.target` to the root, calling handlers assigned using `on<event>`, HTML attributes and `addEventListener` without the 3rd argument or with the 3rd argument `false/{capture:false}`.

Each handler can access `event` object properties:

- `event.target` -- the deepest element that originated the event.
- `event.currentTarget` (=`this`) -- the current element that handles the event (the one that has the handler on it)
- `event.eventPhase` -- the current phase (capturing=1, target=2, bubbling=3).

Any event handler can stop the event by calling `event.stopPropagation()`, but that's not recommended, because we can't really be sure we won't need it above, maybe for completely different things.

The capturing phase is used very rarely, usually we handle events on bubbling. And there's a logical explanation for that.

In real world, when an accident happens, local authorities react first. They know best the area where it happened. Then higher-level authorities if needed.

The same for event handlers. The code that set the handler on a particular element knows maximum details about the element and what it does. A handler on a particular `<td>` may be suited for that exactly `<td>`, it knows everything about it, so it should get the chance first. Then its immediate parent also knows about the context, but a little bit less, and so on till the very top element that handles general concepts and runs the last one.

Bubbling and capturing lay the foundation for "event delegation" -- an extremely powerful event handling pattern that we study in the next chapter.

Let's start with an example.

This handler is assigned to `<div>`, but also runs if you click any nested tag like `<em>` or `<code>`:

```html autorun height=60
<div onclick="alert('The handler!')">
  <em>If you click on <code>EM</code>, the handler on <code>DIV</code> runs.</em>
</div>
```

Isn't it a bit strange? Why does the handler on `<div>` run if the actual click was on `<em>`?
