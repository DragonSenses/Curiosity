## Specification

[The ECMA-262 specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm) contains the most in-depth, detailed and formalized information about JavaScript. It defines the language.

But being that formalized, it's difficult to understand at first. So if you need the most trustworthy source of information about the language details, the specification is the right place. But it's not for everyday use.

A new specification version is released every year. Between these releases, the latest specification draft is at <https://tc39.es/ecma262/>.

To read about new bleeding-edge features, including those that are "almost standard" (so-called "stage 3"), see proposals at <https://github.com/tc39/proposals>.

Also, if you're developing for the browser, then there are other specifications covered in the [second part](info:browser-environment) of the tutorial.
