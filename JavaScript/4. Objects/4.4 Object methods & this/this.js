/* Object Methods: this 
Summary
    - Functions that are stored in object properties are called "methods".
    - Methods allow objects to "act" like object.doSomething().
    - Methods can reference the object as this.

The value of this is defined at run-time.
    - When a function is declared, it may use this, but that this has no value 
    until the function is called.
    - A function can be copied between objects.
    - When a function is called in the "method" syntax: object.method(), 
    the value of this during the call is object.

Please note that arrow functions are special: they have no this. 
When this is accessed inside an arrow function, it is taken from outside.
*/

/* Objects are usually created to represent entities of the real world, like
users, orders and so on. And just like in the real world, a user can "act"
i.e. select something from the shopping cart, login, logout, etc. 

    Actions are represented in JavaScript by functions in properties.

Aside: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is writing code using objects to 
represent entities. 
*/
// Let's teach the user to say Hi
let user = {
    name: "Luna",
    age: 20,
};

// Assign a Function Expression to user.sayHi property of object user
user.sayHi = function () {
    console.log("Hi!");
};

user.sayHi(); // calling the method

// A function that is a property of an object is called its method

// Of course we can use a pre-declared function as a method:
let test = {
    name: "Luna",
    age: 20,
};

// first, declare
function sayHi() {
    alert("Hello!");
}

// then add as a method
test.sayHi = sayHi;

test.sayHi(); // Hello!


/* Shorter Syntax for methods in an Object Literal */
// these objects do the same

user = {
    sayHi: function () {
        alert("Hello");
    }
};

// method shorthand looks better, right?
user = {
    sayHi() { // same as "sayHi: function(){...}"
        alert("Hello");
    }
};

// Notations are not fully identical, there are subtle differences related to
// object inheritance. But for most cases, shorter syntax is preferred

/* "this" in methods */
/* It is common that an object method needs to access the information stored in
the object to do its job. To access the object, a method can use "this" keyword

The value of "this" is the object "before dot", the one used to call the method
*/

user = {
    name: "Luna",
    age: 20,

    sayName() {
        // "this" is the "current object"
        console.log(this.name);
    }
};

// During execution of user.sayName() value of "this" will be "user"
user.sayName(); // Luna

// Note it is possible to reference obj without this, via outer variable
// such as console.log(user.name) instead of console.log(this.name) but code is unreliable
// example is when you null out the user then call its method

/* "this" is not bound 
In JavaScript, keyword this behaves unlike most other programming langauges.
    - It can be used in any function, even if it's not a method of an object.
    - Value of this evaluated during run-time, depending on the context.

There is no syntax error in the following example:
*/
function sayHi() {
    console.log(this.name);
}

/* The same function is assigned to two different objects and has different 
"this" in the calls */
user = { name: "Luna" };
let admin = { name: "Admin" };

// Use the same function in two objects
user.f = sayHi;
admin.f = sayHi;

// these calls have different this
// "this" inside the function is the object "before the dot"
user.f();  // Luna  (this == user)
admin.f(); // Admin  (this == admin)

admin['f'](); // Admin (dot or square brackets access the method â€“ doesn't matter)

// if obj.f() is called, then this is obj during the call of f.

/* Calling without an object: this == undefined 
When calling a function without an object at all, this is undefined in strict mode.
In non-strict mode the value of this in such case wiull be the global object
(window in a browser). This is a historical behavior that "use strict" fixes. 

Usually such a call is a programming error. If there's this inside a function it
expects to be called in an object context.
*/
function callWithoutObject() {
    alert(this);
}

callWithoutObject(); // undefined   (in strict mode)

/* Consequences of unbound this 
In JavaScript, "this" is "free", its value is evaluated at call-time and does 
not depend on where the method was declared, but rather on what object is 
"before the dot".

The concept of run-time evaluated this has both pluses and minuses. 
    - On one hand, a function can be reused for different objects.
    - On the other hand, the greater flexibility creates more possibilities 
    for mistakes. 
*/

/* Arrow functions have no "this" 
Arrow functions are special: they don't have their "own" this. 
    - If we reference this from such a function, it's taken from the outer
    "normal" function.
    - Useful when we actually do not want to have a separate this, but rather
    to take it from the outer context
    
For instance, here arrow() uses "this" from the outer "user.sayHi()" method:
*/
user = {
    firstName: "Luna",
    sayHi() {
        let arrow = () => alert(this.firstName);
        arrow();
    }
};

user.sayHi(); // Luna
