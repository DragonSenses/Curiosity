/* Object to Primitive Conversion */
/* Summary 
  The object-to-primitive conversion is called automatically by many built-in 
  functions and operators that expect a primitive as a value.

There are 3 types (hints) of it:
  - "string" (for alert and other operations that need a string)
  - "number" (for maths)
  - "default" (few operators, usually objects implement it the same way as "number")

The specification describes explicitly which operator uses which hint.

    The conversion algorithm is:
  1. Call obj[Symbol.toPrimitive](hint) if the method exists,
  2. Otherwise if hint is "string"
    - try calling obj.toString() or obj.valueOf(), whatever exists.
  3. Otherwise if hint is "number" or "default"
    - try calling obj.valueOf() or obj.toString(), whatever exists.

    All these methods must return a primitive to work (if defined).

In practice, it’s often enough to implement only obj.toString() as a “catch-all” 
method for string conversions that should return a “human-readable” representation 
of an object, for logging or debugging purposes.
