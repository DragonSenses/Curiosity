/* Object.keys, values, entries */
/* Previously, we saw methods: map.keys(), map.values(), map.entries(). 
These methods are generic, there is a common agreement to use them for data structures. 
If we ever create a data structure of our own, we should implement them too.

They are supported for:
* Map
* Set
* Array

Plain objects also support similar methods, but the syntax is a bit different.

Object.keys, values, entries
For plain objects, the following methods are available:

* Object.keys(obj) – returns an array of keys.
* Object.values(obj) – returns an array of values.
* Object.entries(obj) – returns an array of [key, value] pairs.

Please note the distinctions (compared to map for example):
