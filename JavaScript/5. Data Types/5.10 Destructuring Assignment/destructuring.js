/* Destructuring Assignment */
/* Summary
- Destructuring assignment allows for instantly mapping an object or array onto many variables.

The full object syntax:
        let {prop : varName = default, ...rest} = object

    * This means that property prop should go into the variable varName and, 
      if no such property exists, then the default value should be used.

    * Object properties that have no mapping are copied to the rest object.

The full array syntax:
        let [item1 = default, item2, ...rest] = array

    * The first item goes to item1; the second goes into item2, 
      all the rest makes the array rest.

- Itâ€™s possible to extract data from nested arrays/objects, for that the left side 
must have the same structure as the right one.
