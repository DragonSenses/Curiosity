/* Destructuring assignment */
/* We have an object:

let user = {
  name: "John",
  years: 30
};

Write the destructuring assignment that reads:

 - name property into the variable name.
 - years property into the variable age.
 - isAdmin property into the variable isAdmin (false, if no such property)

Hereâ€™s an example of the values after your assignment:

let user = { name: "John", years: 30 };

// your code to the left side:
// ... = user

console.log( name ); // John
console.log( age ); // 30
console.log( isAdmin ); // false
*/




/* The maximal salary */
/* There is a salaries object: 
let salaries = {
  "John": 100,
  "Pete": 300,
  "Mary": 250
};

Create the function topSalary(salaries) that returns the name of the top-paid person.

 - If salaries is empty, it should return null.
 - If there are multiple top-paid persons, return any of them.
 
P.S. Use Object.entries and destructuring to iterate over key/value pairs.
