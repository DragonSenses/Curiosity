/* JSON methods, toJSON */
/* Summary
 - JSON is a data format that has its own independent standard and libraries 
 for most programming languages.

 - JSON supports plain objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, and null.

 - JavaScript provides methods JSON.stringify to serialize into JSON and 
 JSON.parse to read from JSON.

 - Both methods support transformer functions for smart reading/writing.

 - If an object has toJSON, then it is called by JSON.stringify. */
