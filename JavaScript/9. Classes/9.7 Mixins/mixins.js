/* Mixins */
/* Summary
Mixin â€“ is a generic object-oriented programming term: a class that contains 
methods for other classes.

Some other languages allow multiple inheritance. JavaScript does not support 
multiple inheritance, but mixins can be implemented by copying methods into 
prototype.

We can use mixins as a way to augment a class by adding multiple behaviors, 
like event-handling as we have seen above.

Mixins may become a point of conflict if they accidentally overwrite 
existing class methods. So generally one should think well about the naming 
methods of a mixin, to minimize the probability of that happening.
