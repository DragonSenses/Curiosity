/* Nullish Coalescing Operator ?? */
/* Summary 
    - The nullish coalescing operator ?? provides a short way to choose the 
    first defined value from a list.
    -It's used to assign default values to variables
        e.g., // set height=100, if height is null or undefined
        height = height ?? 100;

    - The operator ?? has a very low precedence, only a bit higher than ? and =
    so consider adding parentheses when using it an expression.
    - It's forbidden to use it with || or && without explicit parentheses
