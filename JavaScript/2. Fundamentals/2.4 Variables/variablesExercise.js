/** Working with Variables
 * 1. Declare two variables: admin and name.
 * 2. Assign the value "John" to name. 
 * 3. Copy the value from name to admin.
 * 4. Show the value of admin using alert (must output “John”).

 * 1. Create a variable with the name of our planet. How would you name such a variable?
 * 2. Create a variable to store the name of a current visitor to a website. 
 * How would you name that variable?
