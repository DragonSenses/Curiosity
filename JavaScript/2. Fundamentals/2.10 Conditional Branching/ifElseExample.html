<!-- 
/* Name of JavaScript  
Use if..else construct, where code asks "What is official name of JavaScript"

If visitor enters "ECMAScript" output "Right!"
Otherwise, output "It's ECMAScript!"
*/

NOTE: Equality (loose == vs. strict ===)

Avoid loose == and use strict === when:
    - If either side of the comparison could be true or false value
    - If either value in a comparison could be of these specific values:
        {0, "", or [] an empty array }
In all other cases, you're safe to use "==" as it simplfieds code in a way
that improves readability.
