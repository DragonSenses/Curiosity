    <p>Before the script</p>

<!--  Hello World Program 

A classic intro program that outs the String "Hello, world!" in a browser.

    Programs in JavaScript are called "scripts".
        Note the use of the <script> tag in HTML makes this JavaScript code Internal.

Internal, just before the </head> tag, insert <script> // JS Code </script>
External, put <script src="script.js" defer></script>, then add JS Code to "script.js" file

Steps:
    1. Starting off we have a DOCTYPE declaration that declares what HTML version to use
    2. Inside the body, we have two paragraphs that contain the script
    3. Using the <script> element, we put JavaScript code within using a 
    browser-specific command "alert()" which displays a dialog with an optional
    message, and to wait until user dismisses the dialog.
