/* Export and Import */
/* Summary 
  Here are all types of export that we covered.

- Before declaration of a class/function/‚Ä¶:
  - export [default] class/function/variable ...

- Standalone export:
  - export {x [as y], ...}.

- Re-export:
  - export {x [as y], ...} from "module"
  - export * from "module" (doesn‚Äôt re-export default).
  - export {default [as y]} from "module" (re-export default).

Import:

- Importing named exports:
  - import {x [as y], ...} from "module"

- Importing the default export:
  - import x from "module"
  - import {default as x} from "module"

- Import all:
  - import * as obj from "module"

- Import the module (its code runs), but do not assign any of its exports to variables:
  - import "module"

We can put import/export statements at the top or at the bottom of a script, 
  that doesn‚Äôt matter.

So, technically this code is fine:

  sayHi();

  // ...

  import {sayHi} from './say.js'; // import at the end of the file


In practice imports are usually at the start of the file, but that‚Äôs only 
  for more convenience.

Please note that import/export statements don‚Äôt work if inside {...}.

A conditional import, like this, won‚Äôt work:

if (something) {
  import {sayHi} from "./say.js"; // Error: import must be at top level
}

‚Ä¶But what if we really need to import something conditionally? Or at the 
right time? Like, load a module upon request, when it‚Äôs really needed?

We‚Äôll see dynamic imports in the next article.

/* Export before declarations */
/* We can label any declaration as exported by placing export before it, 
be it a variable, function or a class.

For instance, here all exports are valid: */

// export an array
export let months = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar','Apr', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'];

// export a constant
export const MODULES_BECAME_STANDARD_YEAR = 2015;

// export a class
export class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

/* No semicolons after export class/function */
/* Please note that export before a class or a function does not make it a 
function expression. It‚Äôs still a function declaration, albeit exported.

Most JavaScript style guides don‚Äôt recommend semicolons after function and 
class declarations.

That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs no need for a semicolon at the end of export class and 
export function: */

export function sayHi(user) {
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
}  // no ; at the end


/* Export apart from declarations */
/* Also, we can put export separately.

Here we first declare, and then export: */

// üìÅ say.js
function sayHi(user) {
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
}

function sayBye(user) {
  alert(`Bye, ${user}!`);
}

export {sayHi, sayBye}; // a list of exported variables

/* ‚Ä¶Or, technically we could put export above functions as well. */


/* Import * 
Usually, we put a list of what to import in curly braces import {...}, like this: */

// üìÅ main.js
import {sayHi, sayBye} from './say.js';

sayHi('John'); // Hello, John!
sayBye('John'); // Bye, John!

/* But if there‚Äôs a lot to import, we can import everything as an object 
using import * as <obj>, for instance: */

// üìÅ main.js
import * as say from './say.js';

say.sayHi('John');
say.sayBye('John');

/* At first sight, ‚Äúimport everything‚Äù seems such a cool thing, short to write,
why should we ever explicitly list what we need to import?

Well, there are few reasons.

1. Explicitly listing what to import gives shorter names: 
    - sayHi() instead of say.sayHi().

2. Explicit list of imports gives better overview of the code structure: 
what is used and where. It makes code support and refactoring easier. */

/* Don‚Äôt be afraid to import too much */
/* Modern build tools, such as webpack and others, bundle modules together and 
optimize them to speedup loading. They also removed unused imports.

For instance, if you import * as library from a huge code library, and then 
use only few methods, then unused ones will not be included into the optimzed
bundle. */

/* Import ‚Äúas‚Äù */
/* We can also use as to import under different names.

For instance, let‚Äôs import sayHi into the local variable hi for brevity, and 
import sayBye as bye: */

// üìÅ main.js
import {sayHi as hi, sayBye as bye} from './say.js';

hi('John'); // Hello, John!
bye('John'); // Bye, John!


/* Export ‚Äúas‚Äù */
/* The similar syntax exists for export.

Let‚Äôs export functions as hi and bye: */

// üìÅ say.js
// ...
export {sayHi as hi, sayBye as bye};

/* Now hi and bye are official names for outsiders, to be used in imports: */

// üìÅ main.js
import * as say from './say.js';

say.hi('John'); // Hello, John!
say.bye('John'); // Bye, John!

/* Export default */
/* In practice, there are mainly two kinds of modules. 
  1. Modules that contain a library, pack of functions, like say.js above.
  2. Modules that declare a single entity, e.g. a module user.js exports only class User.
  
Mostly, the second approach is preferred, so that every ‚Äúthing‚Äù resides in its own module.

Naturally, that requires a lot of files, as everything wants its own module, 
but that‚Äôs not a problem at all. Actually, code navigation becomes easier if 
files are well-named and structured into folders.

Modules provide a special export default (‚Äúthe default export‚Äù) syntax to make 
the ‚Äúone thing per module‚Äù way look better.

Put export default before the entity to export: 
*/

// üìÅ user.js
export default class User { // just add "default"
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

/* There may be only one export default per file.

‚Ä¶And then import it without curly braces: */

// üìÅ main.js
import User from './user.js'; // not {User}, just User

new User('John');

/* Imports without curly braces look nicer. A common mistake when starting 
to use modules is to forget curly braces at all. So, remember, import needs 
curly braces for named exports and doesn‚Äôt need them for the default one.


Named export                Default export
export class User {...}     export default class User {...}
import {User} from ...      import User from ...


Technically, we may have both default and named exports in a single module, but
in practice people usually don‚Äôt mix them. A module has either named exports or
the default one.

As there may be at most one default export per file, the exported entity may have no name.

For instance, these are all perfectly valid default exports:

export default class { // no class name
  constructor() { ... }
}

export default function(user) { // no function name
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
}

// export a single value, without making a variable
export default ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar','Apr', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'];


Not giving a name is fine, because there is only one export default per file, so 
import without curly braces knows what to import.

Without default, such an export would give an error:

export class { // Error! (non-default export needs a name)
  constructor() {}
}
*/


/* The ‚Äúdefault‚Äù name */
/* In some situations the default keyword is used to reference the default export.

For example, to export a function separately from its definition: */
function sayHi(user) {
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
}

// same as if we added "export default" before the function
export {sayHi as default};

/* Or, another situation, let‚Äôs say a module user.js exports one main ‚Äúdefault‚Äù
thing, and a few named ones (rarely the case, but it happens): 

// üìÅ user.js
export default class User {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

export function sayHi(user) {
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
}


Here‚Äôs how to import the default export along with a named one:

// üìÅ main.js
import {default as User, sayHi} from './user.js';

new User('John');


And, finally, if importing everything * as an object, then the default 
property is exactly the default export:

// üìÅ main.js
import * as user from './user.js';

let User = user.default; // the default export
new User('John');
*/


/* A word against default exports */
/* Named exports are explicit. They exactly name what they import, so 
we have that information from them; that‚Äôs a good thing.

Named exports force us to use exactly the right name to import: 
*/
import {User} from './user.js';
// import {MyUser} won't work, the name must be {User}

/* ‚Ä¶While for a default export, we always choose the name when importing: */
import User from './user.js'; // works
import MyUser from './user.js'; // works too
// could be import Anything... and it'll still work

/* So team members may use different names to import the same thing, and that‚Äôs not good.

Usually, to avoid that and keep the code consistent, there‚Äôs a rule that 
imported variables should correspond to file names, e.g: */
import User from './user.js';
import LoginForm from './loginForm.js';
import func from '/path/to/func.js';

/* Still, some teams consider it a serious drawback of default exports. 
So they prefer to always use named exports. Even if only a single thing is 
exported, it‚Äôs still exported under a name, without default.

That also makes re-export (see below) a little bit easier. */
