/* Modules, introduction */
/* Summary
To summarize, the core concepts are:

1. A module is a file. To make import/export work, browsers need 
<script type="module">. Modules have several differences:
  - Deferred by default.
  - Async works on inline scripts.
  - To load external scripts from another origin (domain/protocol/port), 
  CORS headers are needed.
  - Duplicate external scripts are ignored.
2. Modules have their own, local top-level scope and interchange functionality 
via import/export.
3. Modules always use strict.
4. Module code is executed only once. Exports are created once and shared 
between importers.

When we use modules, each module implements the functionality and exports it. 
Then we use import to directly import it where it‚Äôs needed. The browser loads 
and evaluates the scripts automatically.

In production, people often use bundlers such as Webpack to bundle modules 
together for performance and other reasons.

/* As our application grows bigger, we want to split it into multiple files, 
so called ‚Äúmodules‚Äù. A module may contain a class or a library of functions 
for a specific purpose.

For a long time, JavaScript existed without a language-level module syntax. 
That wasn‚Äôt a problem, because initially scripts were small and simple, so 
there was no need.

But eventually scripts became more and more complex, so the community 
invented a variety of ways to organize code into modules, special libraries 
to load modules on demand.

To name some (for historical reasons): 
  - AMD ‚Äì one of the most ancient module systems, initially implemented by the 
  library require.js.
  - CommonJS ‚Äì the module system created for Node.js server.
  - UMD ‚Äì one more module system, suggested as a universal one, compatible with
  AMD and CommonJS.

Now these all slowly became a part of history, but we still can find them in old scripts.

The language-level module system appeared in the standard in 2015, gradually 
evolved since then, and is now supported by all major browsers and in Node.js. 
So we‚Äôll study the modern JavaScript modules from now on.

/* What is a module? */
/* A module is just a file. One script is one module. As simple as that.

Modules can load each other and use special directives export and import 
to interchange functionality, call functions of one module from another one:

  - "export" keyword labels variables and functions that should be accessible 
  from outside the current module.
  - "import" allows the import of functionality from other modules. 
  
For instance, if we have a file sayHi.js exporting a function: 

// üìÅ sayHi.js
export function sayHi(user) {
  alert(`Hello, ${user}!`);
}

‚Ä¶Then another file may import and use it:

// üìÅ main.js
import {sayHi} from './sayHi.js';

alert(sayHi); // function...
sayHi('John'); // Hello, John!



The import directive loads the module by path ./sayHi.js relative to the 
current file, and assigns exported function sayHi to the corresponding variable.

Let‚Äôs run the example in-browser.

As modules support special keywords and features, we must tell the browser 
that a script should be treated as a module, by using the attribute 
<script type="module">.

Like this:

// In üìÅ say.js
export function sayHi(user) {
  return `Hello, ${user}!`;
}

// In üìÅ index.html
<!doctype html>
<script type="module">
  import {sayHi} from './say.js';

  document.body.innerHTML = sayHi('John');
</script>

The browser automatically fetches and evaluates the imported module (and its 
imports if needed), and then runs the script.
*/

/* Note: Modules work only via HTTP(s), not locally */
/* If you try to open a web-page locally, via file:// protocol, you‚Äôll find 
that import/export directives don‚Äôt work. Use a local web-server, such as 
static-server or use the ‚Äúlive server‚Äù capability of your editor, such as 
VS Code Live Server Extension to test modules. */


/* Core module features */
/* What‚Äôs different in modules, compared to ‚Äúregular‚Äù scripts?

There are core features, valid both for browser and server-side JavaScript. 

1. Always ‚Äúuse strict‚Äù

Modules always work in strict mode. E.g. assigning to an undeclared variable 
will give an error.

<script type="module">
  a = 5; // error
</script>



2. Module-level scope

Each module has its own top-level scope. In other words, top-level variables 
and functions from a module are not seen in other scripts.

In the example below, two scripts are imported, and hello.js tries to use user 
variable declared in user.js. It fails, because it‚Äôs a separate module (you‚Äôll
see the error in the console):

// In üìÅ hello.js
alert(user); // no such variable (each module has independent variables)

// In üìÅ user.js
let user = "John";

// In üìÅ index.html
<!doctype html>
<script type="module" src="user.js"></script>
<script type="module" src="hello.js"></script>


Modules should export what they want to be accessible from outside and import 
what they need.
  - user.js should export the user variable.
  - hello.js should import it from user.js module.

In other words, with modules we use import/export instead of relying on global variables.

This is the correct variant:

// In üìÅ hello.js
import {user} from './user.js';

document.body.innerHTML = user; // John


// In üìÅ user.js
export let user = "John";

// In üìÅ index.html
<!doctype html>
<script type="module" src="hello.js"></script>
