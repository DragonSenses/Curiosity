/* Add method "f.defer(ms)" to functions */
/* Add to the prototype of all functions the method defer(ms), that runs 
the function after ms milliseconds.

After you do it, such code should work: */
function f() {
  alert("Hello!");
}

f.defer(1000); // shows "Hello!" after 1 second






/* Add the decorating "defer()" to functions */
/* Add to the prototype of all functions the method defer(ms), that returns a 
wrapper, delaying the call by ms milliseconds.

Hereâ€™s an example of how it should work: */
function f(a, b) {
  alert( a + b );
}

f.defer(1000)(1, 2); // shows 3 after 1 second

/* Please note that the arguments should be passed to the original function. */
