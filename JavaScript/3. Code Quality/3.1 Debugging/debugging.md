# Debugging in the Browser

    Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors within a script. All modern browsers and most other environments support debugging tools â€“ a special UI in developer tools that makes debugging much easier. It also allows to trace the code step by step to see what exactly is going on.

> Note: Will be using Chrome to demonstrate.
