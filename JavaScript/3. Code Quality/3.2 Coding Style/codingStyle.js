/* Coding Style
The art of programming is to take a complex task and code it in a way that is 
both correct and human-readable. A good code style greatly assists in that.

Rules on Syntax aim to increase the readability of your code. They are subject
to dispute. The main things to ask are:
    - "What makes code more redable and easier to understand"
    - "What can help us avoid errors?"

Popular style guides allow you to keep up to date with latest ideas about code 
style trends and best practices.
