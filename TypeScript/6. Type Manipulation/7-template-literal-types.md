# Template Literal Types

Template literal types build on [string literal types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#literal-types), and have the ability to expand into many strings via unions.

They have the same syntax as [template literal strings in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals), but are used in type positions. When used with concrete literal types, a template literal produces a new string literal type by concatenating the contents.

```ts
type World = "world";
 
type Greeting = `hello ${World}`;
        // type Greeting = "hello world"
```

When a union is used in the interpolated position, the type is the set of every possible string literal that could be represented by each union member:

```ts
type EmailLocaleIDs = "welcome_email" | "email_heading";
type FooterLocaleIDs = "footer_title" | "footer_sendoff";
 
type AllLocaleIDs = `${EmailLocaleIDs | FooterLocaleIDs}_id`;
          /* type AllLocaleIDs = "welcome_email_id" | "email_heading_id" | "footer_title_id" | "footer_sendoff_id" */
```

For each interpolated position in the template literal, the unions are cross multiplied:

```ts
type AllLocaleIDs = `${EmailLocaleIDs | FooterLocaleIDs}_id`;
type Lang = "en" | "ja" | "pt";
 
type LocaleMessageIDs = `${Lang}_${AllLocaleIDs}`;
            /* type LocaleMessageIDs = "en_welcome_email_id" | "en_email_heading_id" | "en_footer_title_id" | "en_footer_sendoff_id" | "ja_welcome_email_id" | "ja_email_heading_id" | "ja_footer_title_id" | "ja_footer_sendoff_id" | "pt_welcome_email_id" | "pt_email_heading_id" | "pt_footer_title_id" | "pt_footer_sendoff_id" */
```

We generally recommend that people use ahead-of-time generation for large string unions, but this is useful in smaller cases.

## String Unions in Types

The power in template literals comes when defining a new string based on information inside a type.

Consider the case where a function (`makeWatchedObject`) adds a new function called `on()` to a passed object. In JavaScript, its call might look like: `makeWatchedObject(baseObject)`. We can imagine the base object as looking like:

```ts
const passedObject = {
  firstName: "Saoirse",
  lastName: "Ronan",
  age: 26,
};
```

The `on` function that will be added to the base object expects two arguments, an `eventName` (a `string`) and a `callback` (a `function`).

The `eventName` should be of the form `attributeInThePassedObject + "Changed"`; thus, `firstNameChanged` as derived from the attribute `firstName` in the base object.

The `callback` function, when called:

- Should be passed a value of the type associated with the name `attributeInThePassedObject`; thus, since `firstName` is typed as `string`, the callback for the `firstNameChanged` event expects a `string` to be passed to it at call time. Similarly events associated with `age` should expect to be called with a `number` argument

- Should have `void` return type (for simplicity of demonstration)

The naive function signature of `on()` might thus be: `on(eventName: string, callback: (newValue: any) => void)`. However, in the preceding description, we identified important type constraints that we’d like to document in our code. Template Literal types let us bring these constraints into our code.

```ts
const person = makeWatchedObject({
  firstName: "Saoirse",
  lastName: "Ronan",
  age: 26,
});
 
// makeWatchedObject has added `on` to the anonymous Object
 
person.on("firstNameChanged", (newValue) => {
  console.log(`firstName was changed to ${newValue}!`);
});
```

Notice that on listens on the event `"firstNameChanged"`, not just `"firstName"`. Our naive specification of `on()` could be made more robust if we were to ensure that the set of eligible event names was constrained by the union of attribute names in the watched object with “Changed” added at the end. While we are comfortable with doing such a calculation in JavaScript i.e. `Object.keys(passedObject).map(x => `${x}Changed`)`, template literals inside the type system provide a similar approach to string manipulation:

```ts
type PropEventSource<Type> = {
    on(eventName: `${string & keyof Type}Changed`, callback: (newValue: any) => void): void;
};
 
/// Create a "watched object" with an `on` method
/// so that you can watch for changes to properties.
declare function makeWatchedObject<Type>(obj: Type): Type & PropEventSource<Type>;
```

With this, we can build something that errors when given the wrong property:

```ts
const person = makeWatchedObject({
  firstName: "Saoirse",
  lastName: "Ronan",
  age: 26
});
 
person.on("firstNameChanged", () => {});
 
// Prevent easy human error (using the key instead of the event name)
person.on("firstName", () => {});
// Argument of type '"firstName"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"firstNameChanged" | "lastNameChanged" | "ageChanged"'.
 
// It's typo-resistant
person.on("frstNameChanged", () => {});
// Argument of type '"frstNameChanged"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"firstNameChanged" | "lastNameChanged" | "ageChanged"'.
```
