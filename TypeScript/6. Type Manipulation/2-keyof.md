# Keyof Type Operator

The `keyof` type operator

The `keyof` operator takes an object type and produces a string or numeric literal union of its keys. The following type `P` is the same type as `type P = "x" | "y"`:

```ts
type Point = { x: number; y: number };
type P = keyof Point;
    // type P = keyof Point
```

If the type has a `string` or `number` index signature, `keyof` will return those types instead:

```ts
type Arrayish = { [n: number]: unknown };
type A = keyof Arrayish;
    // type A = number
 
type Mapish = { [k: string]: boolean };
type M = keyof Mapish;
    // type M = string | number
```

Note that in this example, `M` is `string | number` â€” this is because JavaScript object keys are always coerced to a string, so `obj[0]` is always the same as `obj["0"]`.

`keyof` types become especially useful when combined with mapped types, which we'll learn more about later.
