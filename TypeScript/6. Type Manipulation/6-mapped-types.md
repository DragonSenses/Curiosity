# Mapped Types

When you donâ€™t want to repeat yourself, sometimes a type needs to be based on another type.

Mapped types build on the syntax for index signatures, which are used to declare the types of properties which have not been declared ahead of time:

```ts
type OnlyBoolsAndHorses = {
  [key: string]: boolean | Horse;
};
 
const conforms: OnlyBoolsAndHorses = {
  del: true,
  rodney: false,
};
```
