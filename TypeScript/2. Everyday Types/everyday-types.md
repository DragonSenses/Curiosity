# Everyday Types

## The primitives: `string`, `number`, and `boolean`

JavaScript has three very commonly used [primitives](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive): `string`, `number`, and `boolean`. Each has a corresponding type in TypeScript. As you might expect, these are the same names you’d see if you used the JavaScript `typeof` operator on a value of those types:

- `string` represents string values like `"Hello, world"`
- `number` is for numbers like `42`. JavaScript does not have a special runtime value for integers, so there’s no equivalent to `int` or `float` - everything is simply number
- `boolean` is for the two values `true` and `false`

> The type names `String`, `Number`, and `Boolean` (starting with capital letters) are legal, but refer to some special built-in types that will very rarely appear in your code. Always use string, number, or boolean for types.

## Arrays

To specify the type of an array like `[1, 2, 3]`, you can use the syntax `number[]`; this syntax works for any type (e.g. `string[]` is an array of strings, and so on). You may also see this written as `Array<number>`, which means the same thing. We’ll learn more about the syntax `T<U>` when we cover generics.

> Note that [number] is a different thing; refer to the section on [Tuples](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html#tuple-types).

## `any`

TypeScript also has a special type, `any`, that you can use whenever you don’t want a particular value to cause typechecking errors.

When a value is of type `any`, you can access any properties of it (which will in turn be of type `any`), call it like a function, assign it to (or from) a value of any type, or pretty much anything else that’s syntactically legal:

```ts
let obj: any = { x: 0 };
// None of the following lines of code will throw compiler errors.
// Using `any` disables all further type checking, and it is assumed 
// you know the environment better than TypeScript.
obj.foo();
obj();
obj.bar = 100;
obj = "hello";
const n: number = obj;
```

The `any` type is useful when you don’t want to write out a long type just to convince TypeScript that a particular line of code is okay.

### `noImplicitAny`

When you don’t specify a type, and TypeScript can’t infer it from context, the compiler will typically default to `any`.

You usually want to avoid this, though, because `any` isn’t type-checked. Use the compiler flag [noImplicitAny](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#noImplicitAny) to flag any implicit `any` as an error.

## Type Annotations on Variables

When you declare a variable using `const`, `var`, or `let`, you can optionally add a type annotation to explicitly specify the type of the variable

```ts
let myName: string = "Alice";
```

> TypeScript doesn’t use “types on the left”-style declarations like `int x = 0;` Type annotations will always go after the thing being typed.

In most cases, though, this isn’t needed. Wherever possible, TypeScript tries to automatically *infer* the types in your code. For example, the type of a variable is inferred based on the type of its initializer:

```ts
// No type annotation needed -- 'myName' inferred as type 'string'
let myName = "Alice";
```

For the most part you don’t need to explicitly learn the rules of inference. If you’re starting out, try using fewer type annotations than you think - you might be surprised how few you need for TypeScript to fully understand what’s going on.

## Functions

Functions are the primary means of passing data around in JavaScript. TypeScript allows you to specify the types of both the input and output values of functions.

### Parameter Type Annotations

When you declare a function, you can add type annotations after each parameter to declare what types of parameters the function accepts. Parameter type annotations go after the parameter name:

```ts
// Parameter type annotation
function greet(name: string) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name.toUpperCase() + "!!");
}
```

When a parameter has a type annotation, arguments to that function will be checked:

```ts
// Would be a runtime error if executed!
greet(42);
Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'.
```

> Even if you don’t have type annotations on your parameters, TypeScript will still check that you passed the right number of arguments.

### Return Type Annotations

You can also add return type annotations. Return type annotations appear after the parameter list:

```ts
function getFavoriteNumber(): number {
  return 26;
}
```

Much like variable type annotations, you usually don’t need a return type annotation because TypeScript will infer the function’s return type based on its `return` statements. The type annotation in the above example doesn’t change anything. Some codebases will explicitly specify a return type for documentation purposes, to prevent accidental changes, or just for personal preference.

### Anonymous Functionsv

Anonymous functions are a little bit different from function declarations. When a function appears in a place where TypeScript can determine how it’s going to be called, the parameters of that function are automatically given types.

Here’s an example:

```ts
const names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Eve"];
 
// Contextual typing for function - parameter s inferred to have type string
names.forEach(function (s) {
  console.log(s.toUpperCase());
});
 
// Contextual typing also applies to arrow functions
names.forEach((s) => {
  console.log(s.toUpperCase());
});
```

Even though the parameter `s` didn’t have a type annotation, TypeScript used the types of the `forEach` function, along with the inferred type of the array, to determine the type `s` will have.

**This process is called *contextual typing* because the context that the function occurred within informs what type it should have.**

Similar to the inference rules, you don’t need to explicitly learn how this happens, but understanding that it does happen can help you notice when type annotations aren’t needed. Later, we’ll see more examples of how the context that a value occurs in can affect its type.

## Object Types

Apart from primitives, the most common sort of type you’ll encounter is an `object` type. This refers to any JavaScript value with properties, which is almost all of them! To define an object type, we simply list its properties and their types.

For example, here’s a function that takes a point-like object:

```ts
// The parameter's type annotation is an object type
function printCoord(pt: { x: number; y: number }) {
  console.log("The coordinate's x value is " + pt.x);
  console.log("The coordinate's y value is " + pt.y);
}
printCoord({ x: 3, y: 7 });
```

Here, we annotated the parameter with a type with two properties - `x` and `y` - which are both of type `number`. You can use `,` or `;` to separate the properties, and the last separator is optional either way.

The type part of each property is also optional. If you don’t specify a type, it will be assumed to be `any`.

### Optional Properties

Object types can also specify that some or all of their properties are *optional*. To do this, add a `?` after the property name:

```ts
function printName(obj: { first: string; last?: string }) {
  // ...
}
// Both OK
printName({ first: "Bob" });
printName({ first: "Alice", last: "Alisson" });
```

In JavaScript, if you access a property that doesn’t exist, you’ll get the value `undefined` rather than a runtime error. Because of this, when you *read* from an optional property, you’ll have to check for `undefined` before using it.

```ts
function printName(obj: { first: string; last?: string }) {
  // Error - might crash if 'obj.last' wasn't provided!
  console.log(obj.last.toUpperCase());
'obj.last' is possibly 'undefined'.
  if (obj.last !== undefined) {
    // OK
    console.log(obj.last.toUpperCase());
  }
 
  // A safe alternative using modern JavaScript syntax:
  console.log(obj.last?.toUpperCase());
}
```

## Union Types

TypeScript’s type system allows you to build new types out of existing ones using a large variety of operators. Now that we know how to write a few types, it’s time to start *combining* them in interesting ways.

### Defining a Union Type

The first way to combine types you might see is a union type. A union type is a type formed from two or more other types, representing values that may be any one of those types. We refer to each of these types as the union’s members.

Let’s write a function that can operate on strings or numbers:

```ts
function printId(id: number | string) {
  console.log("Your ID is: " + id);
}
// OK
printId(101);
// OK
printId("202");
// Error
printId({ myID: 22342 });
Argument of type '{ myID: number; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string | number'.
```

### Working with Union Types

It’s easy to provide a value matching a union type - simply provide a type matching any of the union’s members. If you have a value of a union type, how do you work with it?

TypeScript will only allow an operation if it is valid for every member of the union. For example, if you have the union `string | number`, you can’t use methods that are only available on `string`:

```ts
function printId(id: number | string) {
  console.log(id.toUpperCase());
Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'string | number'.
  Property 'toUpperCase' does not exist on type 'number'.
}
```

The solution is to *narrow* the union with code, the same as you would in JavaScript without type annotations. *Narrowing* occurs when TypeScript can deduce a more specific type for a value based on the structure of the code.

For example, TypeScript knows that only a `string` value will have a `typeof` value `"string"`:

```ts
function printId(id: number | string) {
  if (typeof id === "string") {
    // In this branch, id is of type 'string'
    console.log(id.toUpperCase());
  } else {
    // Here, id is of type 'number'
    console.log(id);
  }
}
```

Another example is to use a function like `Array.isArray`:

```ts
function welcomePeople(x: string[] | string) {
  if (Array.isArray(x)) {
    // Here: 'x' is 'string[]'
    console.log("Hello, " + x.join(" and "));
  } else {
    // Here: 'x' is 'string'
    console.log("Welcome lone traveler " + x);
  }
}
```

Notice that in the `else` branch, we don’t need to do anything special - if `x` wasn’t a `string[]`, then it must have been a `string`.

Sometimes you’ll have a union where all the members have something in common. For example, both arrays and strings have a `slice` method. If every member in a union has a property in common, you can use that property without narrowing:

```ts
// Return type is inferred as number[] | string
function getFirstThree(x: number[] | string) {
  return x.slice(0, 3);
}
```

> It might be confusing that a union of types appears to have the intersection of those types’ properties. This is not an accident - the name union comes from type theory. The union number | string is composed by taking the union of the values from each type. Notice that given two sets with corresponding facts about each set, only the intersection of those facts applies to the union of the sets themselves. For example, if we had a room of tall people wearing hats, and another room of Spanish speakers wearing hats, after combining those rooms, the only thing we know about every person is that they must be wearing a hat.

## Type Aliases

We’ve been using object types and union types by writing them directly in type annotations. This is convenient, but it’s common to want to use the same type more than once and refer to it by a single name.

A **type alias** is exactly that - a name for any type. The syntax for a type alias is:

```ts
type Point = {
  x: number;
  y: number;
};
 
// Exactly the same as the earlier example
function printCoord(pt: Point) {
  console.log("The coordinate's x value is " + pt.x);
  console.log("The coordinate's y value is " + pt.y);
}
 
printCoord({ x: 100, y: 100 });
```

You can actually use a type alias to give a name to any type at all, not just an object type. For example, a type alias can name a union type:

```ts
type ID = number | string;
```
