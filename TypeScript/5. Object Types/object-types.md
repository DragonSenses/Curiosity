# Object Types

In JavaScript, the fundamental way that we group and pass around data is through objects. In TypeScript, we represent those through *object types*.

As we’ve seen, they can be anonymous:

```ts
function greet(person: { name: string; age: number }) {
  return "Hello " + person.name;
}
```

or they can be named by using either an interface:

```ts
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
 
function greet(person: Person) {
  return "Hello " + person.name;
}
```

or a type alias:

```ts
type Person = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};
 
function greet(person: Person) {
  return "Hello " + person.name;
}
```

In all three examples above, we’ve written functions that take objects that contain the property `name` (which must be a `string`) and `age` (which must be a `number`).

## Quick Reference

We have cheat-sheets available for both [type and interface](https://www.typescriptlang.org/cheatsheets), if you want a quick look at the important every-day syntax at a glance.
