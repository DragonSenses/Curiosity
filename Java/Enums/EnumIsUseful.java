package Java.Enums;

/**
 * Enumerations serve the purpose of representing a group of named constants in
 * a programming language.
 * 
 * Enum constants are implicitly static and final and you can not change their
 * value once created.
 * 
 * Benefits:
 * 1. Enum is Type-Safe, cannot assign anything else other than predefined Enum
 * constants to an Enum variable. 
 * 2. Enum has its own namespace.
 * 3. Can use Java Enum inside Switch statements like int or char primitive 
 * data types. 
 * 4. Maintainability - adding new constants on Enum is easy, and does not break
 * existing code
 * 5. Enum in Java are reference types like class or interface and you can define
 * constructor, methods, and variables inside java Enum which makes it more 
 * powerful than Enum in C/C++
 * 6. Can specify values of enum constants at creation time 
 * 
 * A Java enumeration is a class type. Although we donâ€™t need need to instantiate
 * an enum using new, it has the same capabilities as other classes. Just like 
 * classes, you can: 
 * - Give them constructors
 * - Add instance variables and methods
 * - Implement interfaces.
 * 
 * One thing to keep in mind is that, unlike classes, enumerations neither inherit
 * other classes nor can get extended(i.e become superclass).
