/**
 * ConcurrentHashMap class provides a more modern HashMap which is also 
 * concurrency friendly. Allows concurrent add and update operations that lock
 * only certain parts of the internal data structure. Thus, read and write 
 * operations have improved performance compared with the synchronized HashTable
 * 
 * ================================= Methods =================================
 * ConcurrentHashMap supports three new kinds of operations, with each supporting
 * four forms: accepting functions with keys, values, Map.entry, and (key,value)
 * arguments. 
 * 
 * -forEach() - Performs a given action for each (key, value)
 * -reduce() - Combines all (key,value) given a reduction function into a result
 * -search()
