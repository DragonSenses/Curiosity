/**
 * Java 8 introduced new methods into the List and Set interfaces.
 * 
 * All these methods mutate the collections on which they're invoked. They 
 * change the collection itself, unlike stream operations, which produce a new
 * (copied) result. Since modifying collections can be error-prone and verbose, 
 * these methods were added.
 * 
 * ================================= Methods =================================
 * -removeIf() -  
 * -replaceAll() -
 * -sort() -
