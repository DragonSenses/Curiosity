package Java.Java8.Collections;

/**
 * Java 8 introduced new methods into the List and Set interfaces.
 * 
 * All these methods mutate the collections on which they're invoked. They 
 * change the collection itself, unlike stream operations, which produce a new
 * (copied) result. Since modifying collections can be error-prone and verbose, 
 * these methods were added.
 * 
 * ================================= Methods =================================
 * -removeIf() -  removes element matching a predicate. Available on all 
 * classes that implement List or Set (inherited from Collection interface)
 * 
 * -replaceAll() - replaces elements using a (UnaryOperator) function. 
 * Available on List.
 * 
 * -sort() - sorts the list itself, available on list.
