/**
 * Prefer Lambdas to Anonymous Classes. 
 * 
 * The Comparator interface represents an abstract strategy for sorting; 
 * the anonymous class above is a concrete strategy for sorting strings.
 * The verbosity of anonymous classes, however, made functional programming
 * in Java an unappealing prospect.
 * 
 * In Java 8, the language formalized the notion that interfaces with a single
 * abstract method are special and deserve special treatment. These interfaces
 * are now known as functional interfaces, and the language allows you to create
 * instances of these interfaces using lambda expressions, or lambdas for short.
 * 
 * Lambdas are similar in function to anonymous classes, far more concise. 
 * 
 * Omit the types of all lambda parameters unless their presence makes your
 * program clearer. If the compiler generates an error telling you it canâ€™t infer
 * the type of a lambda parameter, then specify it. Sometimes you may have to cast
 * the return value or the entire lambda expression.
