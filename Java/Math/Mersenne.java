/**
 * A Mersenne number is of the form Mn = 2^n - 1, where n is an integer.
 * - Binary Repunits: consists of all 1's in base-2
 * - For Mersenne number to be a prime number, then n must be prime, so
 * should be denoted as Mp = 2^p - 1. 
 * - Mersennes primes is one of the most computationally intensive
 * 
 * To Do: 
 * - Make an array of mersenne
 * - Stream of Number of digits of mersenne number
 * - sequence of numbers representing the of digits of each mersenne
