# Three Types of Lists

1. Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. 
    
    >- A set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order
    
    >- A legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number.

2. Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).

3. Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.
