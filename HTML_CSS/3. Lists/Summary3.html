<!-- HTML provides 3 different types of lists

1. Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for
a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract
where each point needs to be identified by a section
number.

2. Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).

3. Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.


            Summary
1. Ordered lists use numbers
2. Unordered lists use bullets
3. Definition lists are used to define terminology
- Lists can be nested inside one another.
