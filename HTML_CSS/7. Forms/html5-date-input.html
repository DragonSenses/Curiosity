<!-- HTML5: Date Input

	<input> type="date"
		If you are asking the user for a date, you can use an <input> element
	and give the type attribute a value of date. This will create a date input
	in browsers that support the new HTML5 input types. 
		The appearance of the date input changes across different browsers. 

	Many forms need to gather information such as dates, emails addresses, and
URLs. Traditionally, this has been done using text inputs. HTML5 introduces new
form controls to standardize the way that some information is gathered. 
	Older  browsers that do not recognize these inputs will just treat them as
a single line text box.
