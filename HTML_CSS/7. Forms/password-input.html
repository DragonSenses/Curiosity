<!-- Password Input
<input> type="password" 
	When the type attribute has a value of password it creates a text box that 
acts just like a single-line text input, except the characters are blocked out.
	They are hidden in this way so that if someone is looking over the user's 
shoulder, they cannot see sensitive data such as passwords.

name - attribute indicates the name of the password input, which is sent to the
	server with the password the user enters

size, maxlength - attributes like the single-line text input, that determines
	width of text input and attribute to limit the number of characters a user
	may enter into the text field respectively. 

NOTE: Although the password is hidden on the screen, this does not mean that 
the data in a password control is sent securely to the server. You should 
NEVER use these for sending sensitive data such as credit card numbers.

For full security, the server needs to be set up to communicate
with users browsers using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).
