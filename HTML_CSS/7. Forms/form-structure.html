<!-- Forms
	
<form> - form controls live inside a <form> element. This should always carry 
	the action attribute and will usually have a method and id attribute too.

action - its value is the URL for the page on the server that will receive the
	information in the form when it is submitted. 

method - forms can be sent using of two methods: "get" or "post"
	-get method where the values from the form are added to the end of the URL
	specified in the "action" attribute. 
		-short forms (such as search boxes)
		- when you are just retrieving data from the web server (not sending 
		information that should be added to or deleted from a database)

	-post method the values are sent in what are known as HTTP headers. If form
		- Allows Users to Upload a File
		- Is very long
		- Contains Sensitive Data (e.g. passwords)
		- adds information to, or deletes information from, a database

If the method attribute is not used, the form data will be sent using the get method.

id - the value is used to identify the form distinctly from other elements on the 
page (and is often used by scripts â€” such as those that check you have
entered information into fields that require values).
