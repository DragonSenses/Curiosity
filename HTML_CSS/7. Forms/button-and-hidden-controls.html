<!-- Button & Hidden Controls

	<button> element allows users more control over how their buttons appear,
		and to allow other elements to appear inside the button. Can combine
		text and images between the opening <button> tag and closing tag. 

	<input> type="hidden"
		Example shows a hidden form control. These form controls are not 
		shown on the page (but can bee seen in View Source option). They
		allow web page authors to add values to forms that users cannot see.

		e.g. a web page authhor might use a hidden field to indicate which page
		the user was on when they submitted a form.
