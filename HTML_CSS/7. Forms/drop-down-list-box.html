<!-- Drop Down List Box (a.k.a Select Box)
	
	<select> - A drop down list box (select box) allows users to select one option
		from a drop down list. It contains two or more <option> elements.

		name - attribute indicates the name of the form control being sent to the
			server, along with the value selected.
	
	<option> - element is used to specify the options that the user can select from.
		The words between the opening <option> and closing </option> tags will
		be shown to the user in the drop down box. 

		value - attribute to indicate the value that is sent to the server, along
			with the name of the control if this option is selected.

		selected - attribute can be used to indicate the option that should be
			selected when the page loads. The value of this attribute should 
			be select. If this attribute is not used, the first option will be
			shown when the page loads. If the user does not select an option,
			then the first item will be sent to the server as the value for
			this control.

	Function of a drop down list box is similar to that of the radio buttons (in 
that only one option can be selected). Two key factors in choosing which to use:
		
	1. If users need to see all options at a glance -> Radio Buttons
	2. If there is a very long list of options -> Drop Down List Boxes
