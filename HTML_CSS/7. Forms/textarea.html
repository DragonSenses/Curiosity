<!-- Text Area 

<textarea> - element is used to create a mutli-line text input. Unlike other 
	input elements this is not an empty element. It should therefore have
	an opening and a closing tag.

Any text that appears between the opening <textarea> and closing </textarea> 
tags will appear in the text box when the page loads.

If the user does not delete any text between these tags, this message will get 
sent to the server along with whatever the user has typed. (Some sites use 
JavaScript to clear this information when the user clicks in the text area.)

OLD CODE
If you are creating a new form, you should use CSS to control the width and 
height of a <textarea>. However, if you are looking at older code, you may
see the cols and rows attributes used with this element.

-cols attribute indicates how wide the text area should be (measured in numbers 
of characters).

-rows attribute indicates how many rows the text area should take up vertically.
