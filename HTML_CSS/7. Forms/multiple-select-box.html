<!-- Multiple Select Box
	<select> - can turn a Drop Down Select Box into a box that shows more than
		one option by adding the size attribute.
		
	size - attribute turns into a multiple select box. Its value should be the
		number of options you want to show at once. 
	Unfortunately, the way browsers have implemented this attribute is not perfect,
		should be thoroughly tested if used 
		(in particular in Firefox, & Safari on a Mac)

	multiple - attribute with a value of multiple allows users to select multiple
		options from this list. 

TIP: It is a good idea to tell users if they can select more than one option at
a time. It is also helpful to indicate that on a PC they should hold down the 
control key while selecting multiple options and on a Mac they should use
the command key while selecting options.
