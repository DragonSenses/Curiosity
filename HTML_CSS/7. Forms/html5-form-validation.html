<!-- HTML5: Form Validation 

		Form Validation are the messages given to users when the form control 
	has not been filled in correctly. Traditionally, form validation has been
	performed using JavaScript. But HTML5 is introducing validation and 
	leaving the work to the browser. 

		Validation helps ensure the user enters information in a form that the 
	server will be able to understand when the form is submitted. 

	Validating  the contents of the form before it is sent to the server helps:
		- Reduce the amount of work the server has to do
		- Enables users to see if there are problems with the form faster than
		if validation were performed on the server.

	Still to support older browsers, web page authors are likely to continue 
	using JavaScript to validate forms. 

	"required" attribute can be used on any form element that the user is
		expected to fill in. This does not need a value in HTML5, but in 
		HTML4 all attributes must have a value. So, some people give this 
		attribute a value of required.
