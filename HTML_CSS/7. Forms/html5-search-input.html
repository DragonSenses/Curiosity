<!-- HTML5: Search Input 

	<input> type="search"
		Create a single line text box for search queries, HTML5 provides a 
	special search input. Older browsers will treat it like a single line text
	box. 
		Recent browsers add some features that improve usability. Some adds a 
	cross to clear the search box when you have started to enter information.
	Some round the corners automatically on the search input field. 

	placeholder attribute can be used on any text input, whose value is text 
	that should be shown in the text box until the user clicks in that text area.
	Older browsers ignore this attribute.
