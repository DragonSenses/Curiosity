<!-- Text Input

<input> - element is used to create several different form controls. The value 
of the type attribute determines what kind of input they will be creating.	

type="text" 
	When type attribute has a value of text, it creates a singleline text input.

name - When users enter information into a form, the server needs to know which 
form control each piece of data was entered into.
	(For example, in a login form, the server needs to know what has been entered 
as the username and what has been given as the password.) Therefore, each form
control requires a name attribute.
	The value of this attribute identifies the form control and is sent along 
with the information they enter to the server.

maxlength - You can use the maxlength attribute to limit the number
of characters a user may enter into the text field. 
	Its value is the number of characters they may enter. For example, if you 
were asking for a year, the maxlength attribute could have a value of 4. 

OLD CODE
size - used in older forms to indicate the width of the text input
(measured by the number of characters that would be seen).

For example, a value of 3 would create a box wide enough to display three 
characters (although a user could enter more characters if they desired).

In any new forms you write, CSS should be used to control the width of form elements.
