<!-- Radio Button
	<input> type="radio"
	Radio buttons allow users to pick just one of a number of options

	Attributes
		name - sent to server with the value of the option the user selects.
			When a question provides users with options for answers in the 
			form of radio buttons, the value of the name attribute should be
			the same for all of the radio buttons used to answer that question
		value - indicates value that is sent to the server for the selected 
			option. Value of each of the buttons in a group should be different
			(so that the server knows which option the user has selected)
		checked - can be used to indicate which value (if any) should be selected
			when the page loads. Value of this attribute is checked. Only one
			radio button in a group should use this attribute

	Once a radio button has been selected it cannot be deselected. The user can
only select a different option. If you are only allowing the user one option 
and want them to be able to deselect it (for example if they are indicating 
they agree to terms and conditions), you should use a checkbox instead.
