<!-- File Input Box
	<input> type="file" 
		allows users to upload a file, creating a box that looks like a text
	input followed by a browse button. When user clicks browse, a window opens
	up that allows them to select a file from their computer to be uploaded to
	the website.

	When allowing users to upload files, the method attribute on the <form> 
		element must have a value of post. Cannot send files using the HTTP
		get method.

	When a user clicks on the browse button, the presentation of the window that
	allows them to browse for the file they want to upload will match the windows
	of the user's OS. You cannot control the appearance of these windows.
