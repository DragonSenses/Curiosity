# Summary: Forms

- Whenever you want to collect information from visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a `<form>` element.
- Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
- Each form control is given a name, and the information the user gives (text the user types in or the values of the options they select) are sent to the server
- HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms
