<!-- Labelling Form Controls

	<label> - each form control should have its own <label> element as this
		indicates the purpose of the form control in text. This makes the form
		accessible to vision-impaired users.

	Used in 2 Ways:
		1. Wrap around both the text description and the form input (as shown with Age)
		2. Be kept separate from the form control and use the for attribute to
		indicate which form control it is a label for (as shown with radio buttons)

	for attribute states which form control the label belongs to. Note how the
		radio buttons use the id attribute. The value of the id attribute
		uniquely identifies an element from all other elements on a page. 

	The value of the for attribute matches that of the id attribute on the form
	control it is labelling. 

	- When a <label> element is used with a checkbox or radio button, users can
	click on either the form control or the label to select. 
	
	- The expanded clickable area makes thhe form easier to use. 

	- The position of the label is very important, if users do not know where
	to enter information or what information to enter, they are less likely to
	use the form correctly.
