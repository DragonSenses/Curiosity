<!-- Labelling Form Controls

	<label> - each form control should have its own <label> element as this
		indicates the purpose of the form control in text. This makes the form
		accessible to vision-impaired users.

	Used in 2 Ways:
		1. Wrap around both the text description and the form input (as shown with Age)
		2. Be kept separate from the form control and use the for attribute to
		indicate which form control it is a label for (as shown with radio buttons)
