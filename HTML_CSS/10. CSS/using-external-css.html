<!-- Using External CSS 

	<link> can be used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to find 
		the CSS file used to style the page. 
		- An empty element (does not need a closing tag)
		- Lives inside the <head> element 

	Attributes:
		href - Specifies the path to the CSS file (which is often placed in a 
			   folder call css or styles)
		type - Specifies the type of document being linked to. The value should
		       be text/css
		rel - Specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file it
		      is linked to. The value should be stylesheet when linking to a CSS file

	Note: An HTML page can use more than one CSS style sheet. It has to use 
	<link> element for every CSS file it uses. Some authors use one CSS file
	to control the presentation (such as fonts and colors) and a second to 
	control the layout.
