<!-- Using Internal CSS 

	<style> element sits inside the <head> element of the page, which adds CSS 
		rules within an HTML page

	 - Should use the type attribute to indicate that the styles are specified 
	 in CSS, the value should be text/css.

Note: Its best to use external CSS style sheet as it offers benefits:
	- Allows all pages to use the same style rules (rather than repeating 
	them in each page)
	- Keeps the content separate from how the page looks
	- Means you can change the styles used across all pages by altering 
	just one file (rather than each individual page)
