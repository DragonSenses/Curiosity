<!-- CSS Rules Cascade
	
1. Last Rule 
	- If the two selectors are identical, the latter of the two will take precedence
2. Specificity 
	- If one selector is more specific than the others, the more specific rule will
	take precedence over more general ones. 
3. Important
	- Add !important after any property value to indicate that it should be 
	considered more important than other rules that apply to the same element

	- Rule Precedence when 2+ rules apply to same element 
	- Understanding how CSS rules cascade means you can write simpler style 
	sheets because you can create generic rules that apply to most elements 
	and then override properties on individual elements that need to appear differently
