<!-- Inheritance

	If you specify the font-family or color properties on the <body> element, 
they will apply to most child elements. This is because the value of the 
font-family property is inherited by child elements. Saves you from having to 
apply these properties to as many elements (and results in simpler style sheets).

	Compare to background-color or border properties, they are not inherited by 
child elements. 

Can force a lot of properties to inherit values from their parent elements by 
using inherit for the value of the properties. 

	In example, the <div> element with a class called page inherits padding size 
from the CSS rule that applies to the <body> element.
