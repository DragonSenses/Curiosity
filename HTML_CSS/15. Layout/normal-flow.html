		<h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
		<p>In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him get around the royal gardens faster: two same-size in-line wheels, the front one steerable, mounted in a frame upon which you straddled. The device was propelled by pushing your feet against the ground, thus rolling yourself and the device forward in a sort of gliding walk.</p>
		<p>The machine became known as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse"). It was made entirely of wood. This enjoyed a short lived popularity as a fad, not being practical for transportation in any other place than a well maintained pathway such as in a park or garden.</p>
		<p>The next appearance of a two-wheeled riding machine was in 1865, when pedals were applied directly to the front wheel. This machine was known as the velocipede (meaning "fast foot") as well as the "bone shaker," since it's wooden structure combined with the cobblestone roads of the day made for an extremely uncomfortable ride. They also became a fad and indoor riding academies, similar to roller rinks, could be found in large cities.</p>

Normal Flow

In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next
one. Since this is the default way in which browsers treat
HTML elements, you do not need a CSS property to indicate
that elements should appear in normal flow, but the syntax
would be:

  position: static;

See how it stretches the width of the entire browser window by default.

The paragraphs are restricted to 450 pixels wide. This shows
how the elements in normal flow start on a new line even if they
do not take up the full width of the browser window.
