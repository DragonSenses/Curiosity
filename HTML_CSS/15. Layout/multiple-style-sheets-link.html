<!-- Multiple Style Sheets - link

  On this page you can see the other technique for including multiple style 
sheets. Inside the <head> element is a separate <link> element for each style
sheet.

  The contents of `site.css` are identical to `styles.css` in 
`multiple-style-sheets-import`, except the code does not contain 
@import rules.

As with all style sheets, if two rules apply to the same element
then rules that appear later in a document will take precedence 
over previous rules.

In this example `multiple-style-sheets-link.html`, any rules in `typography.css` 
would take precedence over rules in `site.css` (because the typography rules 
are included after the other rules).

In the previous example `multiple-style-sheets-import.html`, the rules in 
`styles.css` would take precedence over the rules in `typography.css`. 
This is because when the `@import` rule is used, that is the point at
which the browser considers the rules live.
