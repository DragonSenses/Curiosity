		<h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
		<p>In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him get around the royal gardens faster.</p>
		<p>The device know as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse") was made of wood, and propelled by pushing your feed on the ground in a gliding movement.</p>
		<p>It was not seen a suitable for any place other than a well maintained pathway. </p>
		<p>In 1865, the velocipede (meaning "fast foot") attached pedals to the front wheel, but its wooden structure made it extremely uncomfortable. </p>
		<p>In 1870 the first all-metal machine appeared. The pedals were attached directly to the front wheel. 
		<p>Solid rubber tires and the long spokes of the large front wheel provided a much smoother ride than its predecessor.</p>

<!-- using-float

  A lot of layouts place boxes next to each other. The float
property is commonly used to achieve this.

  When elements are floated, the height of the boxes can affect
where the following elements sit.

  In this example, you can see six paragraphs, each of which has a
width and a float property set.

  The fourth paragraph does not go across to the left hand edge
of the page as one might expect. Rather it sits right under the third paragraph.

  The reason for this is that the fourth paragraph has space to
start under the third paragraph, but it cannot go any further to
the left because the second paragraph is in the way.

  Setting the height of the paragraphs to be the same
height as the tallest paragraph would solve this issue, but it
is rarely suited to real world designs where the amount of
text in a paragraph or column may vary. It is more common
to use the clear property to solve this issue.
