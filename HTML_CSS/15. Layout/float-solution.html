		<h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
		<div>
			<p>In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him get around the royal gardens faster.</p>
			<p>The device know as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse") was made of wood, and propelled by pushing your feed on the ground in a gliding movement.</p>
			<p>It was not seen a suitable for any place other than a well maintained pathway. </p>
			<p class="clear">In 1865, the velocipede (meaning "fast foot") attached pedals to the front wheel, but its wooden structure made it extremely uncomfortable.</p>
			<p>In 1870 the first all-metal machine appeared. The pedals were attached directly to the front wheel. 
			<p>Solid rubber tires and the long spokes of the large front wheel provided a much smoother ride than its predecessor.</p>

<!-- float solution -- parents of floated elements


  Traditionally, developers got around this problem by adding
an extra element after the last floated box (inside the
containing element). A CSS rule would be applied to this
additional element setting the clear property to have a value
of both. But this meant that an extra element was added to the
HTML just to fix the height of the containing element.

  More recently, developers have opted for a purely CSS-based
solution because it means that there is no need to add an extra
element to the HTML page after the floated elements. The pure
CSS solution adds two CSS rules to the containing element (in this
example the <div> element):

  1.  The overflow property is given a value auto.

  2. The width property is set to 100%.
