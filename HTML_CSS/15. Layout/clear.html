		<h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
		<p>In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him get around the royal gardens faster.</p>
		<p>The device know as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse") was made of wood, and propelled by pushing your feed on the ground in a gliding movement.</p>
		<p>It was not seen a suitable for any place other than a well maintained pathway. </p>
		<p class="clear">In 1865, the velocipede (meaning "fast foot") attached pedals to the front wheel, but its wooden structure made it extremely uncomfortable.</p>
		<p>In 1870 the first all-metal machine appeared. The pedals were attached directly to the front wheel. 
		<p>Solid rubber tires and the long spokes of the large front wheel provided a much smoother ride than its predecessor.</p>

<!-- clear

The clear property allows you to say that no element (within
the same containing element) should touch the left or righthand
sides of a box. It can take the following values:

left
The left-hand side of the box
should not touch any other
elements appearing in the same
containing element.

right
The right-hand side of the
box will not touch elements
appearing in the same containing
element.

both
Neither the left nor right-hand
sides of the box will touch
elements appearing in the same
containing element.

none
Elements can touch either side.

  In this example, the fourth paragraph has a class called
clear. The CSS rule for this class uses the clear property
to indicate that nothing should touch the left-hand side of it. The
fourth paragraph is therefore moved further down the page
so no other element touches its left-hand side.
