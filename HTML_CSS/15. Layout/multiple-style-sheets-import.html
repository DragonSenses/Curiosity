<!-- Mutliple Style Sheets

@import

Some web page authors split
up their CSS style rules into
separate style sheets. For
example, they might use one
style sheet to control the layout
and another to control fonts,
colors and so on.

Some authors take an even
more modular approach
to stylesheets, creating
separate stylesheets to control
typography, layout, forms,
tables, even different styles for
each sub-section of a site.

There are two ways to add
multiple style sheets to a page:

1: Your HTML page can link
to one style sheet and that
stylesheet can use the @import
rule to import other style sheets.

2: In the HTML you can use a
separate <link> element for
each style sheet.

The example on this page
uses one <link> element in
the HTML to link to a style
sheet called styles.css. This
stylesheet then uses the
@import rule to import the
typography.css and tables.css files.

If a stylesheet uses the @import
rule, it should appear before the
other rules.
