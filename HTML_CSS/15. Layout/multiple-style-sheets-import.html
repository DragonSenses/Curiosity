<!-- Mutliple Style Sheets

@import

Some web page authors split
up their CSS style rules into
separate style sheets. For
example, they might use one
style sheet to control the layout
and another to control fonts,
colors and so on.

Some authors take an even
more modular approach
to stylesheets, creating
separate stylesheets to control
typography, layout, forms,
tables, even different styles for
each sub-section of a site.
