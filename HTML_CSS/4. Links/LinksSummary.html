<!-- Links are the defining feature of thhe web because they 
allow you to move from one web page to another - enabling the 
very idea of browsing or surfing. 

Types of Links:
- Links from one website to another
- Links from one page to another on the same website
- Links from one part of a web page to another part of the same page
- Links that open in a new browser window
- Links that start up your email program and address a new
email to someone

             -------- Writing Links  -------- 
- Links are created using the <a> element. 
- Users can click on anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag.
- You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

    |---- Opening Link Tag ------|    |--| Closing Link Tag 
    <a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a>
            |-------------------| |--|
        Page the Link Goes To      Text User Clicks On: "IMDB"
        "http://www.imdb.com"

-The text between the opening <a> tag and closing </a> tag
is known as link text. Where possible, your link text should
explain where visitors will be taken if they click on it (rather
than just saying "click here").

-Many people navigate websites by scanning the text for links.
Clear link text can help visitors find what they want. This
will give them a more positive impression of your site and may
encourage them to visit it for longer. (It also helps people
using screen reader software.)

- To write good link text, you can think of words people might
use when searching for the page that you are linking to.
(For example, rather than write "places to stay" you could use
something more specific such as "hotels in New York.")

                -------- Summary  -------- 
- Links are created using the <a> element

- The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate
the page you are linking to. 

- If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.

- You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the "to" field.

- You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.
