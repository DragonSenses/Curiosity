<!-- Links are the defining feature of thhe web because they 
allow you to move from one web page to another - enabling the 
very idea of browsing or surfing. 

Types of Links:
- Links from one website to another
- Links from one page to another on the same website
- Links from one part of a web page to another part of the same page
- Links that open in a new browser window
- Links that start up your email program and address a new
email to someone

                -------- Summary  -------- 
- Links are created using the <a> element
    
- The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate
the page you are linking to. 

- If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.

- You can create links to open email programs with an
email address in the "to" field.

- You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.
