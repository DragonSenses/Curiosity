<!-- 
	If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the
	target attribute on the opening <a> tag. The value of this
	attribute should be _blank.

	One of the most common reasons a web page author might want a link to be
	opened in a new window is if it points to another website. In such cases,
	they hope the user will return to the window containing their site after
	finishing looking at the other one.

	Generally you should avoid opening links in a new window,
	but if you do, it is considered good practice to inform users
	that the link will open a new window before they click on it.
