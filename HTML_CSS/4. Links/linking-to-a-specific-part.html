<!--  id attribute

--------- Linking to a Specific Part of the Same Page ---------
The value of the id attribute should start with a letter or an
underscore (not a number or any other character) and, on a
single page, no two id attributes should have the same value.

Before you can link to a specific part of a page, you need to
identify the points in the page that the link will go to. You do
this using the id attribute (which can be used on every HTML
element). You can see that the <h1> and <h2> elements in this
example have been given id attributes that identify those
sections of the page. 

To link to an element that uses an id attribute you use the <a>
element again, but the value of the href attribute starts with
the # symbol, followed by the value of the id attribute of the
element you want to link to. In this example, <a href="#top">
links to the <h1> element at the top of the page whose id
attribute has a value of top.

--------- Linking to a Specific Part of Another Page ---------
If you want to link to a specific part of a different page (whether
on your own site or a different website) you can use a similar
technique. As long as the page you are linking to has id attributes that
identify specific parts of the page, you can simply add the
same syntax to the end of the link for that page.

Therefore, the href attribute will contain the address for the
page (either an absolute URL or a relative URL), followed by the
# symbol, followed by the value of the id attribute that is used on
the element you are linking to.

For example, to link to the bottom of the homepage of the
website that accompanies this book, you would write:
<a href="http:/www.htmlandcssbookcom/#bottom">
