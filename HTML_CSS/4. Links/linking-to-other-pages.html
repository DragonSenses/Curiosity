<!-- When you are linking to other pages within the same site,
you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You
can use a shorthand known as a relative URL. 

If all the pages of the site are in the same folder, then the value
of the href attribute is just the name of the file.

If you have different pages of a site in different folders, then you
can use a slightly more complex syntax to indicate where the
page is in relation to the current page.

	-------------------- Relative URLS --------------------
- When linking to other pages within the same site, you can
use relative URLs. These are like a shorthand version of absolute
URLs because you do not need to specify the domain name.

- Relative URLs help when building a site on your computer because
you can create links between pages without having to set up
your domain name or hosting.
