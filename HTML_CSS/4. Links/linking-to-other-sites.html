<!-- Links are created using the <a> element which has an attribute called href. 

	The value of the href attribute is the page that you want people to go to
	when they click on the link

Users can click on anything that appears between the opening
<a> tag and the closing </a> tag and will be taken to the page
specified in the href attribute.

When you link to a different website, the value of the href
attribute will be the full web address for the site, which is
known as an absolute URL.

Browsers show links in blue with an underline by default.
