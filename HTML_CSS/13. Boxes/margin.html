<!-- Margin

• margin property controls gap between boxes. Its value is commonly given in pixels 
although you may also use percentages or ems.

• If one box sits on top of another margins are collapsed, which means the larger 
of the two margins will be used and the smaller will be disregarded

Note: If width of a box is specified then the margin is added to the width of the box


You can specify values for each side of a box using:
  margin-top
  margin-right
  margin-bottom
  margin-left

You can also use the shorthand (where the values are in
clockwise order: top, right, bottom, left):

  margin: 1px 2px 3px 4px;

You can also use the shorthand (where the values are in clockwise order: 
  top, right, bottom, left):

  margin: 1px 2px 3px 4px;

Value of margin property is not inherited by child elements in same way color value 
of the font-family property is; so need to specify the margin for every element that
needs to use it
