<!-- Centering Content

• Set left-margin & right-margin to auto to center a box on the page (or center 
it inside the element that it sits in)

• To center a box on the page, you need to set a width for the box (otherwise it 
will take up full width of the page)

• Once width is specified for box, setting left and right margins to auto will 
make browser put an equal gap on each side of the box (or within the element 
that the box sits inside)

Also use text-align property on element that the box sits inside of as its 
value set to center, this is inherited by child elements, there also need to 
specify the text-align property on the centered box if you do not want the text 
inside it to be centered
