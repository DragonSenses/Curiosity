<!-- Display
  
• display property turns an inline element into a block-level element or 
vice versa, can also be used to hide an element from the page

	• inline causes block-level element to act like an inline element
	• block causes an inline element to act like a block-level element
	• inline-block causes a block-level element to flow like an inline element, 
  while retaining other features of a block-level element
	• none hides an element from the page. 
		○ Element acts as though it is not on the page at all (can be seen in view source)
		○ inline boxes are not supposed to create block-level elements
	• Each item in list is treated as block-level element usually, but rule for 
  <li> elements indicates that they should be treated as inline elements, which 
    means they will sit alongside each other rather than appearing on new lines.
		○ This technique is often used to create navigation for a site, and in this 
    example a margin has been added to the right of each of the items to separate them out
		○ Rule that applies to the <li> element whose class is coming-soon has been 
      hidden as if it were not in the page at all
