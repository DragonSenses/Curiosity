<!-- Box Dimensions
  width, height

• By default a box is sized just big enough to hold its contents. To set custom
dimensions for a box use height and width properties
  ○ Popular ways to specify a box is using pixels, percentages, or ems. 
    § Pixels traditionally were most popular because they allow designers to 
    accurately control their size
    § Percentages scales size of the box relative to size of browser window, or 
    if encased within another box, it is a percentage of the size of containing box
    § ems scale size of box based on size of text within it

Responsive Design
○ Percentages and ems are used more recently for measurements as they try to 
  create designs that are flexible across devices which have different sized screens
