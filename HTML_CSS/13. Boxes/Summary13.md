## Border, Margin, & Padding

Every box has 3 available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:

1. Border

  - Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another

2. Margin
  - Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.

3. Padding 
  - Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents.

Note: If you specify a width for a box, then the borders, margin, and padding are added to its width and height.
