<!-- Overflowing Content

○ overflow property tells the browser what to do if the content contained 
within a box is larger than the box itself. 
  § hidden property hides any extra content that does not fit in the box
  § scroll property adds a scrollbar to the box so that users can scroll to 
  see the missing content
  
○ Some browsers allow users to adjust the size of text to appear as large 
or as small as they want
