		<h1>Marine Biology</h1>
		<h2>The Composition of Seawater</h2>
		<p>Almost anything can be found in seawater. This includes dissolved materials from Earth's crust as well as materials released from organisms. The most important components of seawater that influence life forms are salinity, temperature, dissolved gases (mostly oxygen and carbon dioxide), nutrients, and pH. These elements vary in their composition as well as in their influence on marine life.</p>

<!-- HSL & HSLA

- CSS3 introduces an intuitive way to specify colors using Hue, Saturation, and Lightness
	- Hue is colloquial idea of color, represented as a color circle where angle 
	  represents the color (or a slider with values from 0 to 360)
	- Saturation is amount of gray in a color (represented as percentage, 
	  0% is a shade of gray)
	- Lightness is amount of white or black (lights or darkness) in a color. 
		- Represented as a percentage where 0% is Black, 100% is White, 50% is Normal
		- Also referred to as Luminosity

NOTE: Different concept to Brightness which only adds black, whereas lightness offers 
both white and black
