# **Summary: *Color (CSS)***

* Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions 
* Three ways to specify colors in CSS:
    1. RGB Values
    2. Hex Codes
    3. Color Names
* Color pickers can help you find the color you want
* Important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text an background color
* CSS3 has an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
* CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

## Understanding Color

Computer monitors are made up of tiny squares called pixels, which are expressed in terms of a mix of red, green, and blue. 

When a screen is off, it's black because it's not emitting lightt. When on, each pixel can be a different color creating a picture. 

Color can be determined a number of ways:
1. RGB Values (or RGBA)
    * rgb(102,250,170)
2. Hex Codes
    * #66cdaa
    * Red is 66, Green is 205 (cd), Blue is 170 (aa) 
3. Color Names
    * MediumAquaMarine
4. HSL (or HSLA)
    * hsl(0,0%,78%)

## Contrast
    When picking foreground and background colors, ensure that there is enough contrast for text to be legible.

### Low Contrast
- Text is harder to read when there is low contrast
- Lack of contrast is particularly a problem for those with visual impairments and color blindness
- Affects those with poor monitors and sunlight on their screens

### High Contrast
- Text is easier to read when there is higher contrast
- If there is a lot of text on the page 
- However too much contrast can make it harder to read too
- If text is reversed out (a light color on a dark background), you can increase the height between lines and the weight of the font to make it easier to read.

### Medium Contrast
- Reducing contrast a little bit improves readability
- For long spans of text
- Can reduce contrast by using dark gray text on a white background or an off-white text on a dark background
