<!-- Centering Images
 
1. **Block-Level Element Approach:**
   - By default, images are inline elements, which means they flow within the surrounding text.
   - To center an image horizontally, turn it into a block-level element using the `display` property with a value of `block`.
   - Once it's a block-level element, you have two common ways to center it:
     - On the containing element (e.g., a `<div>`), use the `text-align` property with a value of `center`.
     - On the image itself, use the `margin` property and set the left and right margins to `auto`.

2. **Class Names Approach:**
   - You can also specify class names that allow any element (including images) to be centered.
   - These classes can be used similarly to how you apply dimensions or alignment styles.
