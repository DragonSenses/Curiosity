<!-- Controlling Sizes of Images in CSS
  ○ Just like any other box, size of an image can be controlled using the 
  width and height properties in CSS
  ○ Specifying image sizes helps pages load more smoothly because HTML&CSS 
  code often loads before the images, telling the browser how much space to 
  leave for an image allows it to render the rest of the page without 
  waiting for image to download
  ○ A lot of sites use the same sized image across many of their pages, 
  and not have images of all different sizes on a site
  ○ e.g., e-commerce site tends to show product photos @ same size. 
  ○ Or if site designed on a grid, then might have a selection of image 
  sizes that are commonly used on all pages:
  Whenever you use consistently sized images across a site, can use CSS to 
  control the dimensions of the images, instead of putting the dimensions in HTML
