# **Summary: *Images***

- You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS. This is very helpful when you use the same sized images on several pages of your site.

- Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically using CSS.

- You can use a background image behind the box created by any element on a page.

- Background images can appear just once or be repeated across the background of the box.

- You can create image rollover effects by moving the background position of an image.

- To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.
