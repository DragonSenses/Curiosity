<!-- Aligning Form Controls | Solution

Each row of the form has a title telling users what they need to
enter. For the text inputs, the title is in the <label> element.

  For the radio buttons, the title is in a <span> element. Both have
a class attribute with a value of title.

We can use a property called float to move the titles to the
left of the page. 

By setting the width property on those elements, we know that
the titles will each take up the same width. Therefore, the form
controls next to them will line up.

The text-align property is used to align the titles to the
right, and padding is used to make sure there is a gap
between the text in the title boxes and the form controls.

Styles are also applied to the <div> elements that contain
each row of the form (fixing their width and creating vertical
space between each row). The submit button is also aligned to
the right.
