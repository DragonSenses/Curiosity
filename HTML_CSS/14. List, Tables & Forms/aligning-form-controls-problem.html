<!-- Aligning Form Controls | Problem 

Labels for form elements are often different lengths, which
means that the form controls will not appear in a straight line. This
is demonstrated in the example above (without CSS applied
to the form controls).

In this form, each topic we ask the user about is placed inside
a <div> element to ensure that each question appears on a new
line. It is easier for users to fill in a form if the form controls are
aligned in a straight vertical line.

The CSS on the "aligning-form-controls-solution.html" addresses this.

If you look at where we ask users their gender, the two
radio buttons each have their own <label> (one saying male
and another saying female). A <span> element has been added
to the title which will help align
these controls.

Previously, we saw another technique to align form
elements. When the form only contains text inputs, by setting
all of the text inputs to be the same width, as well as aligning
all of the form content to the right, the fields line up and the
labels are in a consistent place.

For more complex forms, you will need a solution more like the
one shown here.
