<!-- border-spacing, border-collapse 

Gaps between cells.

The border-spacing property allows you to control the
distance between adjacent cells.

By default, browsers often leave a small gap between each table
cell, so if you want to increase or decrease this space then
the border-spacing property allows you to control the gap.

The value of this property is usually specified in pixels. You
can specify two values if desired to specify separate numbers for
horizontal and vertical spacing.

When a border has been used on table cells, where two cells
meet, the width of lines would be twice that of the outside edges.

It is possible to collapse adjacent borders to prevent this using the
  border-collapse property.

  Possible values are:

  collapse - Borders are collapsed into a single border where possible. 
  (border-spacing will be ignored and cells pushed together, and empty-cells
  properties will be ignored.)

  separate - Borders are detached from each other. (border-spacing and
empty-cells will be obeyed.)
