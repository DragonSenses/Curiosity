# **Summary: *Lists, Tables & Forms***

- There are CSS properties that are specifically used to control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.

- List markers can be given different appearances using the `list-style-type` and `list-style` image properties.

- Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent.

- Forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS.

- Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more interactive.
