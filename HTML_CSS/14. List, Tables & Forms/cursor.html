<!-- cursor

The cursor property allows you to control the type of mouse
cursor that should be displayed to users.

For example, on a form you might set the cursor to be a hand
when the user hovers over it.

Here are the most commonly used values for this property:

  auto
  crosshair
  default
  pointer
  move
  text
  wait
  help
  url("cursor.gif");

You should only use these values to add helpful information for
users in places they would expect to see that cursor. (For
example, using a crosshair on a link might confuse users because
they are not used to seeing it.)
