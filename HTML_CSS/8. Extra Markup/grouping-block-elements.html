<!-- Grouping Block Elements

	<div> element groups a set of elements together in one block-level box.

		Examples:
		- to contain all the elements for the header of your site 
		(logo and navigation)
		- to contain comments from visitors

	In a browser, contents of <div> element will start on a new line, but other
		than this it will make no difference to the presentation of the page.

	Using an `id` or `class` attribute on the <div> element, means you can create
		CSS style rules to indicate how much space the <div> element should 
		occupy on the screen and change the appearance of all the elements 
		contained within it. 

	Easier to follow code if <div> elements hold each section of the page. 
		- Since several other elements inside a <div> element, helpful to
		add a comment before the closing </div> tag, to clearly see which
		opening tag is supposed to correspond to (as shown at end of code above)
