<!-- id attribute

	A global attribute that can be used on any HTML element, used to uniquely
	identify that element from other elements on the page. 

	- Its value should start with a letter or an underscore
		- Cannot start with a Number or any other character
	- Important: No two elements on the same page have the same value for their
	id attributes (otherwise the value is no longer unique)
	- Elements with unique identities can be styled differently than any other
	instance of the same element on the same page (through CSS)
	- Used to allow a script to work with that particular element (w/ JavaScript)
