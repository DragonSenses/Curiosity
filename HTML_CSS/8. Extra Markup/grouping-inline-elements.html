<!-- Grouping Inline Elements

	<span> acts like an inline equivalent of the <div> element.
		
		1. Contain a section of text where there is no other suitable element
		to differentiate it from its surrounding text
		
		2. Contain a number of inline elements

	Most common reason to use <span> is to control the appearance of the
	content of these elements using CSS. Usually <span> elements are used 
	with a `class` or `id` attribute.

		- To explain the purpose of this <span> element
		- So that CSS Styles can be applied to elements thhat have
		specific values for these attributes
