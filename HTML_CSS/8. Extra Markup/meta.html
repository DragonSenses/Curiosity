<!-- Information About Your Pages 

	<meta> contains information about that web page, lives inside the <head>. 
		An empty element, so does not have a closing tag. Uses attributes to
		carry information.
	
	Invisible to Users but fulfills a number of purposes:
		- Tell search engines about your page
		- Who created it
		- Whether or not it is time sensitive (time sensitive page can be set 
		to expire)
	
	Attributes:
	`name, content` - most common & tend to be used together. 
		- These specify properties of the entire page.
		- Value of `name` is the property you are setting
		- Value of `content` is value you want to give this property

		Most commonly defined values for `name` attribute:
			"description" - contains description of the page, used by search
				engines to understand what page is about, should be a max of
				155 characters. Sometimes displayed in search engine results.

			"keywords" - contains a list of comma-separated words that a user
				may search on to find the page. NOTE: In practice, no longer
				has any noticeable effect on how search engines index your site.

			"robots" - indicates whether search engines should add this page to
				their search results or not. 
			
				1. Content Value of "noindex" if this page should not be added
				2. Content Value of "nofollow" if search engines should add this
				page in their results but not any pages that it links to

	`http-equiv, content` - another attribute pairs 
		Values for http-equiv:
			"author" - defines the author of the web page
			
			"pragma" - prevents the browser from caching the page (i.e. storing
			it locally to save time downloading it on subsequent visits)

			"expires" - to indicate when the page should expire (and no longer
			be cached), since browseers often cache the content of a page. 
			
				Note: Date must be specified in the format 
						"Fri, 04 Apr 2014 23:59:59 GMT"

			"refresh" - instruction specifies:
				* the number of seconds until the page should be reloaded - 
				only if the content attribute contains a non-negative int

				* number of seconds until the page should redirect to another -
				only if the content attribute contains a non-negative integer
				followed by the string `;url=`, and a valid URL

			e.g., <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="3;url=https://www.mozilla.org" />
