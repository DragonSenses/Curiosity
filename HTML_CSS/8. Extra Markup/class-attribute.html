<!-- Class Attribute 

	A global attribute that can be used on any HTML element, used to identify
	several elements as being different from the other elements on the page. 

	- Its value should describe the class it belongs to
		- In above example, key paragraphs have a class attribute whose value
		is "important"
	
	- The class attribute on any element can share the same value
		- Value of "important" can also be used on headings and links too
	
	- By default, will not affect presentation of an element unless a CSS rule
	indicates that its appearance should be displayed differently
		- In example, elements with class attribute whose value is "important" 
		are uppercase, and if value is "admittance" it will be red
		
	- To indicate that an element belongs to several classes, you can separate
	class names with a space (shown in 3rd paragraph where value is "important admittance")

	e.g., paragraphs of text that contain information that is more important
	than others and want to distinguish these elements.
