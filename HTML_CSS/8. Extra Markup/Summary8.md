# **Summary: *Extra Markup***

- DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using
- You can add comments to your code between the  
<! -- and --> markers  
- The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements
- The `<div>` and `<span>` elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together
- `<iframes>` cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed 
- The `<meta>` tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page
- Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as &lt;, &gt;, and &#169; (which is `&lt;`  `&gt;` `&#169` respectively)
