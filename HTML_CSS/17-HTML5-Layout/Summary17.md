# **Summary: *HTML5 Layout***

- The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.

- The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple `<div>` elements).

- Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.

- To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from [HTML5shiv](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv).
