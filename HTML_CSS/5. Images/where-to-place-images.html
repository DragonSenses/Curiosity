<!-- Where an image is place in the code will affect how it is displayed

1. Before a paragraph 
	The paragraphh starts on a new line after the image.

2. Inside the Start of a Paragraph 
	The first row of text aligns with the bottom of the image.

3. In the Middle of a Paragraph
	The image is placed between the words of the paragraph that it
appears in. 

	Where you place the image in the code is important because
	browsers show HTML elements in one of two ways:

I) Block elements always appear on a new line. Examples of block
elements include the <h1> and <p> elements.

If the <img> is followed by a block level element (such as a
paragraph) then the block level element will sit on a new line
after the images. 

II) Inline elements sit within a block level element and do not
start on a new line. Examples of inline elements include the <b>,
<em>, and <img> elements.

If the <img> element is inside ablock level element, any text or
other inline elements will flow around the image
