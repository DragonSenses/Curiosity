<!-- In this example: 
	- The logo is a GIF because it uses flat colors, 
	- The photographs are JPEGs. 
	- The main photo is placed inside the HTML5 <figure> element and
	  has its own caption.
	- The alt attribute on each image provides a description for those
	  using screen readers
	- The title attribute provides additional information.
	
	-This example DOES NOT use the height, width, or align attributes 
	 as these are being phased out and you are encouraged to use CSS
	 properties instead.
