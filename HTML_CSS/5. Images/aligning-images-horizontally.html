<!--  align attribute (Deprecated, still seen in older code)

	The align attribute commonly used to indicate how the other parts of
	a page should flow around an image. 
	It has been removed from HTML5 and new websites should use 
	CSS to control the alignment of images

	The align attribute can take these horizontal values:

		left
	This aligns the image to the left (allowing text to flow around its
	right-hand side).

		right
	This aligns the image to the right (allowing text to flow around its
	left-hand side).

	When you give the align attribute a value of left, the
	image is placed on the left and text flows around it.

	When you give the align attribute a value of right, the
	image is placed on the right and the text flows around it.

	When text flows right up to the edge of an image it can make
	it harder to read.
