<!-- <img>
To add an image into the page use <img> element. 
Empty Element which means there is no closing tag.

It must carry the following two attributes:

1) src - tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will
usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site. 
Here the images are in a child folder called images - a relative URL.

2) alt - provides a text description of the image which describes the 
image if you cannot see it. 

If the image is just to make a page look more attractive (and it has no
meaning, such as a graphic dividing line), then the alt attribute should
still be used but the quotes should be left empty. 

3) title - attribute with the <img> element provides additional information
about the image. Most browsers will dispaly the content of this attribute in
a tooltip when the user hovers over the image.
