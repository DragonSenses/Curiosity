<!--  (Deprecated, Still seen in Old Code)
	There are three values that the align attribute can take that
control how the image should align vertically with the text that
surrounds it:

		top
This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the top of
the image.

		middle
This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the middle
of the image.

		bottom
This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the bottom
of the image.


The value of top places the first line of text near the top of the
image and subsequent lines of text appear under the image.

The value of middle places the first line of text near the
vertical middle of the image and subsequent lines of text appear
under the image.

The value of bottom places the first line of text near the bottom
of the image and subsequent lines of text under the image.

When text flows right up to the edge of an image it can make
it harder to read.
