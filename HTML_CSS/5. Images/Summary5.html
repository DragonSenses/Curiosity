<!-- Images

    There are many reasons why you might want to add an image to a web page: 
you might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram, or chart.

    There are several things to consider when selecting and preparing images
for your site, but taking time to get them right will make it look more
attractive and professional.

Here we:
- Include an image in your web pages using HTML
- Pick which image format to use
- Show an image at the right size
- Optimize an image for use on the web to make pages
load faster

Three Rules for Creating Images
1) Save Images in the Right Format

    Websites mainly use images in jpeg, gif, or png format. If you
choose the wrong image format then your image might not look as sharp
as it should and can make the web page slower to load.

2) Save Images at the Right Size

    You should save the image at the same width and height it will
appear on the website. If the image is smaller than the width or 
height that you have specified, the image can be distorted and stretched.
If the image is larger than the width and height if you have specified,
the image will take longer to display on the page.

3) Use the Correct Resolution

    Computer screens are made up of dots known as pixels. Images
used on the web are also made up of tiny dots. Resolution refers
to the number of dots per inch, and most computer screens only
show web pages at 72 pixels per inch. So saving images at
a higher resolution results in images that are larger than
necessary and take longer to download.

            -------- Image Formats  -------- 
    JPEG - Whenever you have many different colors in a picture. 

A photograph that features snow or an overcast sky might look like it has large
areas that are just white or gray, but the picture is usually made up of many
different colors that are subtly different.

    GIF/PNG - when saving images with few colors or large
areas of the same color.

When a picture has an area that is filled with exactly the same color, it is
known as flat color. Logos, illustrations, and diagrams often use flat colors.
(Note that photographs of snow, sky, or grass are not flat colors, they are
made up of many subtly different shades of the same color and are not as
suited to GIF or PNG format.)

                -------- Summary  -------- 
- The <img> element is used to add images to a web page.

- You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the
source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the
content of an image.

- You should save images at the size you will be using
them on the web page and in the appropriate format.

- Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or
logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.
