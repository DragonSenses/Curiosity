<!-- Images

    There are many reasons why you might want to add an image to a web page: 
you might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram, or chart.

    There are several things to consider when selecting and preparing images
for your site, but taking time to get them right will make it look more
attractive and professional.

Here we:
- Include an image in your web pages using HTML
- Pick which image format to use
- Show an image at the right size
- Optimize an image for use on the web to make pages
load faster

                -------- Summary  -------- 
- The <img> element is used to add images to a web page.

- You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the
source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the
content of an image.

- You should save images at the size you will be using
them on the web page and in the appropriate format.

- Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or
logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.
