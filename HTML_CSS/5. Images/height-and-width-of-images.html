<!-- You will also often see an <img> element use two other attributes
that specify its size:

1) height - This specifies the height of the image in pixels.
2) width - This specifies the width of the image in pixels. 

Images often take longer to load than the HTML code that
makes up the rest of the page. It is, therefore, a good idea to
specify the size of the image so that the browser can render
the rest of the text on the page while leaving the right amount of
space for the image that is still loading.

The size of images is increasingly being specified using CSS rather
than HTML
