		written out row by row.

	<tr> element is the opening tag that indicates the start of each row. It
		is followed by one or more <td> elements (for for each cell in that 
		row). At the end of the row you use a closing tag </tr> tag.

	<td> element stands for table data, each cell of a table is represented
		using a this element and closes with </td> tag. 

	Some browsers automatically draw lines around the table and/or the 
	individual cells.
