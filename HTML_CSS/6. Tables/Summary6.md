# Tables

There are several types of information that need to be displayed in a grid or
table. For example: sports results, stock reports, train timetables.

When representing information in a table, you need to think in terms of a 
grid made up of rows and columns (a bit like a spreadsheet). 

A table represents information in a grid format. 
    *Grids allow us to understand complex data by referencing
     information on two axes. 
    *Each block in the grid is referred to as a table cell. 
     In HTML a table is written out row by row.

- Use the four key elements for creating tables
- Represent complex data using tables
- Add captions to tables



# Summary
- The <table> element is used to add tables to a web page.

- A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created 
with the <tr> element.

- Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the <td> element
(or <th> if it is a header).

- You can make cells of a table span more than one row
or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes.

- For long tables you can split the table into a <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>.
