<!-- Spanning Columns

Sometimes you may need the entries in a table to stretch across more than one
column.

The colspan attribute can be used on a <th> or <td> element and indicates how
many columns that cell should run across.

In the example on the right you can see a timetable with five columns; the 
first column contains the heading for that row (the day), the remaining four
represent one hour time slots.	

If you look at the table cell that contains the words 'Geography'
you will see that the value of the colspan attribute is 2, which
indicates that the cell should run across two columns. In the third
row, 'Gym' runs across three columns.

You can see that the second and third rows have fewer
<td> elements than there are columns. This is because, when
a cell extends across more than one column, the <td> or <th>
cells that would have been in the place of the wider cells are not
included in the code.

CSS styles show how the cells span more than one column.
