<!-- Old Code, all of these attributes have been replaced by the use of CSS
	- "width", "cellpadding", "cellspacing" attribute
	
	There are some outdated attributes which you should not use on new 
websites. You may, however, come across some of them when looking at older code

	The width attribute was used on the opening <table> tag to indicate how wide 
that table should be and on some opening <th> and <td> tags to specify
the width of individual cells.
	The value of this attribute is the width of the table or cell in
pixels. 
	The columns in a table need to form a straight line, so you often
only see the width attribute on the first row (and all subsequent
rows would use that setting).

	The opening <table> tag could also use the cellpadding attribute to add 
space inside each cell of the table, and the cellspacing attribute to create
space between each cell of the table. The values for these attributes were 
given in pixels.
