<!-- Spanning Rows

	You may also need entries in a table to stretch down across
more than one row.

The rowspan attribute can be used on a <th> or <td> element
to indicate how many rows a cell should span down the table.

In the example on the left you can see that ABC is showing a
movie from 6pm - 8pm, whereas the BBC and CNN channels are
both showing two programs during this time period (each of
which lasts one hour).

If you look at the last <tr> element, it only contains three
elements even though there are four columns in the result below.
This is because the movie in the <tr> element above it uses the
rowspan attribute to stretch down and take over the cell below.
