<!-- Table Headings <th>
	The <th> element is used just like the <td> element but its purpose is
to represent the heading for either a column or a row.

Even if a cell has no content, you should still use a <td> or <th> element
to represent the presence of an empty cell otherwise the table will not 
render correctly.

Using <th> elements for headings helps people who use screen readers, improves
the ability for search engines to index your pages, and also enables you to 
control the appearance of tables better when you start to use CSS.

You can use the scope attribute on the <th> element to indicate whether it is 
a heading for a column or a row. It can take the values: row to indicate a 
heading for a row or col to indicate a heading for a column.

Browsers usually display the content of a <th> element in bold and in the 
middle of the cell.
