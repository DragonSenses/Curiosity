# **Summary: *Video & Audio***
* HTML5 introduces new `<video>` and `<audio>` elements for adding video and audio to web pages
* Browsers that support the HTML5 elements do not all support the same video & audio formats, so supply files in different formats to ensure the greatest reach

## Video Formats and Players

> *Encoding* - Process of converting a video into another format

### Formats
- BluRay, DVD, VHS
- AVI, H264, MPEG, Ogg Theora, WebM, QuickTime

### Players & Plugins
- Browsers were initially designed to show text and images only, therefore browsers built prior to 2010 generally required another program called player or plugin to play video content
- Recent browsers evolved to support HTML5 `<video>` tag (rendering players & plugins obsolete)
- Best practice to to use HTML5 `<video>` element, and provide videos in at least two different formats: WebM & MP4
