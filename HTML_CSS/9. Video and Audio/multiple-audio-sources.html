<!-- Mutiple Audio Sources

	<source> possible to specify more than one audio file using <source> element
		between the opening <audio> and closing </audio> tags 
		- Replaces src attribute on the opening <audio> tag
		
	Since different browsers support different formats for audio files, supply
	at least two formats to get coverage across all. 

	Attributes:
		src - indicates where the audio file is located
		type - not commonly being used in the same way it was for the <video> element
