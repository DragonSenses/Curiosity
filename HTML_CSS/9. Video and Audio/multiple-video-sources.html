<!-- Multiple Video Sources
	
	<source> specifies the location of the file to be played. 
		- This should replace the src attribute on the opening <video> tag
		- Should be inside the <video> element
		- Can also use multiple <source> elements to specify that the video is 
		available in different formats.

	Attributes:
	○ src - attribute specifies the path to the video

	○ type - tells the browser what format the video is. 
		Otherwise, it will download some of the video to see if it can play 
		the file (which will take time and bandwidth)

	○ codecs - the codec that was used to encode the video is supplied within 
	the type attribute. 
		Note the use of single quotes, as well as double quotes in the type 
		attribute, when it is supplied.
