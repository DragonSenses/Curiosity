<!--  Adding HTML5 Audio to Pages 

	<audio> adds audio files in pages.
		- Browsers expect different formats for the audio

	Attributes:
		* src - specifies path of audio file

		* controls - indicates wheter the player should display controls
					 If not used, no controls will be shown by default.
					 Can specify own controls using JavaScript. 

		* autoplay - presence of this attribute indicates that the audio should
					start playing automatically (Best practice to omit)

		* preload - indicates what browser should do if the player is not set
					to autoplay. Can have values:
			1. none - browser should not load audio until the user presses play
			2. auto - browser should download the audio when page loads
			3. meta - browser should just collect information such as size, first frame,
				  	  track list, and duration

		* loop - specifies that audio track should play again once it has finished
