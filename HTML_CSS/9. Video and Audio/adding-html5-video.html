<!-- Adding Video to Your Pages 

	<video> element allow for video playback
	
	Attributes:
		src - specifies path to the video 
		
		poster - specifies an image to show while video is downloading, 
			buffering, or until user plays the video
		
		width, height - specify the size of player in pixels

		controls - indicates that the browser should supply its own controls
			for playback

		autoplay - specifies that the file should play automatically

		loop - indicates that the video should start playing again once it has
			ended

	preload - tells the browser what to do when the page loads. Has 1 of 3 values:
		1. none - browser should not load video until the user presses play
		2. auto - browser should download the video when page loads
		3. meta - browser should just collect information such as size, first frame,
				  track list, and duration
				  
Notice in HTML5, do not need to supply values for all attributes such as 
"controls, autoplay, and loop" attributes used with the <video> element. 
These attributes are like on/off switches (booleans), where if present is on, 
if omitted, option is turned off. 

If browser does not support <video> element or format of video used, displays
	whatever is between <video> and closing </video> tags.
