		<p class="intro">The <a class="breed" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briard">briard</a>, or berger de brie, is a large breed of dog traditionally used as a herder and guardian of sheep.</p>
		<h2>Breed History</h2>
		<p>The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred for centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French Army as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers because of its fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War almost to the point of extinction. Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.</p>

<!-- Text Indent

• text-indent property allows you to indent the first line of text within an element. 
	○ Amount you want line indented by can be specified (usually pixels or ems)
	○ Can take a negative value, which means it can be used to push text off the browser window
	○ e.g., have <h1> element pushed off the browser window (instead used a 
		background image to represent the heading) since we do not want it 
		displayed on top of the logo or it will be unreadable
		- Still want heading text to be on page (for search engines and those who cannot see image)
	○ Pushed 9,999 pixels to the left, out of sight but still in HTML code
