		<p class="intro">The <a class="breed" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briard">briard</a>, or berger de brie, is a large breed of dog traditionally used as a herder and guardian of sheep.</p>
		<h2>Breed History</h2>
		<p>The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred for centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French Army as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers because of its fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War almost to the point of extinction. Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.</p>

<!-- Specifying Typefaces

	font-family property allows you to specify the typeface that should be used 
	for any text inside the element to which a CSS rule applies
		- Value is the name of the typeface you want to use
		- Typeface specified should be what users have installed on their computer

	Specify a list of fonts separated by commas so that, if the user does not have 
	your first choice of typeface installed, browser can try to use an alternative 
	font from list
		- Common to end with a generic font name for that type of font
		- If font name is made up of more than one word, put it in double quotes

	Designers suggest pages usually look better if they use no more than 3 typefaces
