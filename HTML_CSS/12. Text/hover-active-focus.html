<!-- Responding to Users    :hover  :active :focus

There are three pseudo-classes that allow you to change the
appearance of elements when a user is interacting with them.

• :hover - applied when a user hovers over an element with a pointing device such as a mouse
		○ Commonly used to change appearance of links and buttons when a user places 
    their cursor over them 
		○ Note: Does not affect devices with touch screens, as screens cannot discern 
    when someone is hovering their finger over an element

• :active - applied when an element is being activated by the user 
  ○ e.g. when a button is being pressed or a link being clicked
  ○ Used to make a Button or Link feel more responsive to the user, being pressed 
  gives feedback by changing the style or position of the element slightly

• :focus - applied when an element has focus, which any element you can interact 
with has, such as a link you can click or any form control
  ○ Occurs when a browser discovers that you are ready to interact with an 
  element on the page
  ○ e.g., when your cursor is in a form input ready to accept typing, that 
  element is said to have focus
  ○ Possible to use the Tab Key on keyboard to move through the interactive 
  items on a page

• When pseudo-classes are used they should appear in this order
  :link, :visited, :hover, :focus, :active
