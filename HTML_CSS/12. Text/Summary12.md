# **Summary: *Text***

- There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style and spacing.
- There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed
- If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them.
- You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.
- You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
