		<p class="intro">The <a class="breed" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briard">briard</a>, or berger de brie, is a large breed of dog traditionally used as a herder and guardian of sheep.</p>
		<h2>Breed History</h2>
		<p>The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred for centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French Army as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers because of its fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War almost to the point of extinction. Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.</p>

<!-- Line Height

line-height - sets the height of an entire line of text, so the difference between
			  the font-size and line-height is equivalent to the leading.
	○ Increasing the line-height makes the vertical gap between lines of text larger
	○ Best given in ems not pixels, so that gap between lines is relative to size of 
	text the user has selected

Leading, the vertical space between lines of text, is measured from the bottom 
of the descender on one line to the top of the ascender on the next
	• descender part of a letter that drops beneath the baseline in a typeface
	• ascender highest point of a letter
