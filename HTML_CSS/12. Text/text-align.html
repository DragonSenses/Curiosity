		<p class="intro">The <a class="breed" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briard">briard</a>, or berger de brie, is a large breed of dog traditionally used as a herder and guardian of sheep.</p>
		<h2>Breed History</h2>
		<p>The briard, which is believed to have originated in France, has been bred for centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French Army as sentries, messengers and to search for wounded soldiers because of its fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War almost to the point of extinction. Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering. Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayette all owned briards.</p>

<!-- Text Alignment

Can take 1 of 4 values:
	• left - indicates text should be left-aligned
		○ Considered easiest to read several paragraphs of text if left-aligned
	• right - indicates text should be right aligned
	• center - centers the text
	• justify - indicates every line in a paragraph, except the last line, 
	            should be set to take up the full width of the containing box
		○ Looks at words on each individual line and creates an equal gap 
		  between those words
		○ Looks odd if lines are not very wide or text contains long words
