<!-- The first time you explain some new terminology in a document, it is
known as the defining instance of it. The <dfn> element is used to indicate
the defining instance of a new term.

Some browsers show the content of the <dfn> element in italics. But 
	Safari and Chrome do not change its appearance. -->
