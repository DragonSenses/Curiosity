		<h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
		<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
		<p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
		<p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>

<!-- Strucutural Markup includes elements such as <h1>, <h2>, and <p>
	 Semantic Information is carried in elements such as <cite> and <em> -->

<!-- Structural Markup are elements that you can use to describe both headings
and paragraphs -->

<!-- Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such
as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something
you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the
meaning of acronyms, and so on -->

<!-- Semantic Markup are text elements that are not intended to affect the
structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the pages. 
Browsers often display the contents of these elements in a different way. 
Should not use them to change the way that your text looks; their purpose is
to describe the content of your web pages more accurately.  

Other programs such as screen readers or search engines use this extra 
information. For example, voice of a screen reader may add emphasis to the
words inside <em> element, or a search engine might register that your page
features a quote if you use the <blockquote> element. -->
