<!-- Two Elements used for marking up quotations. 
	<blockquote> used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph.
		Note how the <p> element is still used inside the <blockquote> element.
		Browsers tend to indent the contents of the it, however you should not
		use this element just to indent a piece of text - rather you should 
		achieve this effect using CSS.
	<q> element is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph. 
		Browsers are supposed to put quotes around the <q> element, however
		Internet Explorer does not (therefore many avoid using it)
	Both elements may use the cite attritube to indicate where the quote is
	from. Its value should be a URL that will have more information about the
	source of quotation. -->
