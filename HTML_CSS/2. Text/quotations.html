<!-- Two Elements used for marking up quotations. 
	<blockquote> used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph.
		Note how the <p> element is still used inside the <blockquote> element.
		Browsers tend to indent the contents of the it, however you should not
		use this element just to indent a piece of text - rather you should 
		achieve this effect using CSS.
