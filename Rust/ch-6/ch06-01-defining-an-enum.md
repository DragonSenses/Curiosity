## Defining an Enum

Where structs give you a way of grouping together related fields and data, like a `Rectangle` with its `width` and `height`, enums give you a way of saying a value is one of a possible set of values. For example, we may want to say that `Rectangle` is one of a set of possible shapes that also includes `Circle` and `Triangle`. To do this, Rust allows us to encode these possibilities as an enum.
