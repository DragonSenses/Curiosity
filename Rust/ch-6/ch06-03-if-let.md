## Concise Control Flow with `if let`

The `if let` syntax lets you combine `if` and `let` into a less verbose way to handle values that match one pattern while ignoring the rest. 

Consider the program in Listing 6-6 that matches on an `Option<u8>` value in the `config_max` variable but only wants to execute code if the value is the `Some` variant.

```rust
    let config_max = Some(3u8);
    match config_max {
        Some(max) => println!("The maximum is configured to be {max}"),
        _ => (),
    }
```

If the value is `Some`, we print out the value in the `Some` variant by binding the value to the variable `max` in the pattern. We donâ€™t want to do anything with the `None` value. To satisfy the `match` expression, we have to add `_ => ()` after processing just one variant, which is annoying boilerplate code to add.

Instead, we could write this in a shorter way using `if let`. The following code behaves the same as the `match` in Listing 6-6:

```rust
    let config_max = Some(3u8);
    if let Some(max) = config_max {
        println!("The maximum is configured to be {max}");
    }
```
