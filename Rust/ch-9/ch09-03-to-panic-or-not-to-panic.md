## To `panic!` or Not to `panic!`

### Deciding Between `panic!` and `Result`

- **When to Use `panic!`**:
  - Use `panic!` when there is no way to recover from an error.
  - Calling `panic!` makes the decision that a situation is unrecoverable on behalf of the calling code.

- **When to Return `Result`**:
  - Returning `Result` gives the calling code options to handle the error.
  - The calling code can attempt to recover or decide that the error is unrecoverable and call `panic!` itself.
  - Returning `Result` is a good default choice for functions that might fail.

#### Situations for Using `panic!`

- **Examples, Prototype Code, and Tests**:
  - In these cases, it's more appropriate to write code that panics instead of returning a `Result`.

#### Compiler Limitations and Human Judgment

- **Compiler Limitations**:
  - There are situations where the compiler can't tell that failure is impossible, but you as a human can.

#### Guidelines for Library Code

- **General Guidelines**:
  - The chapter concludes with guidelines on how to decide whether to panic in library code.

### Additional Considerations

- **Using the `?` Operator**:
  - The `?` operator can be used to propagate errors in functions that return `Result` or `Option`.
  - It simplifies error handling by reducing boilerplate code.

- **Error Handling in Production Code**:
  - In production code, prefer returning `Result` to allow for graceful error handling.
  - Reserve `panic!` for truly unrecoverable situations or bugs.

### Examples, Prototype Code, and Tests

#### Examples

When you're writing an example to illustrate some concept, including robust error-handling code can make the example less clear. In examples, it's understood that a call to a method like `unwrap` that could panic is meant as a placeholder for the way you'd want your application to handle errors, which can differ based on what the rest of your code is doing.

#### Prototype Code

Similarly, the `unwrap` and `expect` methods are very handy when prototyping, before you're ready to decide how to handle errors. They leave clear markers in your code for when you're ready to make your program more robust.

#### Tests

If a method call fails in a test, you'd want the whole test to fail, even if that method isn't the functionality under test. Because `panic!` is how a test is marked as a failure, calling `unwrap` or `expect` is exactly what should happen.

### Cases in Which You Have More Information Than the Compiler

#### Using `unwrap` or `expect` with Additional Logic

It is appropriate to call `unwrap` or `expect` when you have some other logic that ensures the `Result` will have an `Ok` value, but the logic isn't something the compiler understands. You'll still have a `Result` value that you need to handle: whatever operation you're calling still has the possibility of failing in general, even though it's logically impossible in your particular situation.

#### Ensuring No `Err` Variant

If you can ensure by manually inspecting the code that you'll never have an `Err` variant, it's perfectly acceptable to call `unwrap`, and even better to document the reason you think you'll never have an `Err` variant in the `expect` text. Here's an example:

```rust
use std::net::IpAddr;

let home: IpAddr = "127.0.0.1"
    .parse()
    .expect("Hardcoded IP address should be valid");
```

#### Example Explanation

We're creating an `IpAddr` instance by parsing a hardcoded string. We can see that `127.0.0.1` is a valid IP address, so it's acceptable to use `expect` here. However, having a hardcoded, valid string doesn't change the return type of the `parse` method: we still get a `Result` value, and the compiler will still make us handle the `Result` as if the `Err` variant is a possibility because the compiler isn't smart enough to see that this string is always a valid IP address.

#### Handling User Input

If the IP address string came from a user rather than being hardcoded into the program and therefore *did* have a possibility of failure, we'd definitely want to handle the `Result` in a more robust way instead. Mentioning the assumption that this IP address is hardcoded will prompt us to change `expect` to better error-handling code if, in the future, we need to get the IP address from some other source instead.

### Guidelines for Error Handling

#### When to Use `panic!`

It's advisable to have your code panic when it's possible that your code could end up in a bad state. In this context, a *bad state* is when some assumption, guarantee, contract, or invariant has been broken, such as when invalid values, contradictory values, or missing values are passed to your codeâ€”plus one or more of the following:

- The bad state is something that is unexpected, as opposed to something that will likely happen occasionally, like a user entering data in the wrong format.
- Your code after this point needs to rely on not being in this bad state, rather than checking for the problem at every step.
- There's not a good way to encode this information in the types you use. We'll work through an example of what we mean in the ["Encoding States and Behavior as Types"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch17-03-oo-design-patterns.html#encoding-states-and-behavior-as-types) section of Chapter 17.

#### Handling Invalid Values

If someone calls your code and passes in values that don't make sense, it's best to return an error if you can so the user of the library can decide what they want to do in that case. However, in cases where continuing could be insecure or harmful, the best choice might be to call `panic!` and alert the person using your library to the bug in their code so they can fix it during development. Similarly, `panic!` is often appropriate if you're calling external code that is out of your control and it returns an invalid state that you have no way of fixing.

#### Expected Failures

When failure is expected, it's more appropriate to return a `Result` than to make a `panic!` call. Examples include a parser being given malformed data or an HTTP request returning a status that indicates you have hit a rate limit. In these cases, returning a `Result` indicates that failure is an expected possibility that the calling code must decide how to handle.

#### Safety and Security

When your code performs an operation that could put a user at risk if it's called using invalid values, your code should verify the values are valid first and panic if the values aren't valid. This is mostly for safety reasons: attempting to operate on invalid data can expose your code to vulnerabilities. This is the main reason the standard library will call `panic!` if you attempt an out-of-bounds memory access: trying to access memory that doesn't belong to the current data structure is a common security problem.

#### Function Contracts

Functions often have *contracts*: their behavior is only guaranteed if the inputs meet particular requirements. Panicking when the contract is violated makes sense because a contract violation always indicates a caller-side bug, and it's not a kind of error you want the calling code to have to explicitly handle. In fact, there's no reasonable way for calling code to recover; the calling *programmers* need to fix the code. Contracts for a function, especially when a violation will cause a panic, should be explained in the API documentation for the function.

#### Using Rust's Type System

Having lots of error checks in all of your functions would be verbose and annoying. Fortunately, you can use Rust's type system (and thus the type checking done by the compiler) to do many of the checks for you. If your function has a particular type as a parameter, you can proceed with your code's logic knowing that the compiler has already ensured you have a valid value. For example, if you have a type rather than an `Option`, your program expects to have *something* rather than *nothing*. Your code then doesn't have to handle two cases for the `Some` and `None` variants: it will only have one case for definitely having a value. Code trying to pass nothing to your function won't even compile, so your function doesn't have to check for that case at runtime. Another example is using an unsigned integer type such as `u32`, which ensures the parameter is never negative.

### Guidelines for Error Handling | Summary

- **When to Use `panic!`**:
  - Use `panic!` when your code could end up in a bad state (e.g., invalid, contradictory, or missing values).
  - Bad state is unexpected and can't be easily encoded in types.
  - Example: Out-of-bounds memory access.

- **Handling Invalid Values**:
  - Return an error if possible to let the user decide how to handle it.
  - Use `panic!` if continuing could be insecure or harmful.
  - Example: Calling external code that returns an invalid state.

- **Expected Failures**:
  - Return a `Result` for expected failures (e.g., malformed data, rate limits).
  - Indicates that failure is an expected possibility.

- **Safety and Security**:
  - Verify values are valid before performing operations that could put a user at risk.
  - Use `panic!` for invalid values to prevent vulnerabilities.

- **Function Contracts**:
  - Functions have contracts that guarantee behavior if inputs meet requirements.
  - Panicking on contract violations indicates a caller-side bug.
  - Document contracts in API documentation.

- **Using Rust's Type System**:
  - Use Rust's type system to perform checks at compile time.
  - Example: Using a type instead of `Option` to ensure a value is always present.
  - Example: Using unsigned integers to prevent negative values.
