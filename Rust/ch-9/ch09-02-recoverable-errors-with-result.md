## Recoverable Errors with `Result`

### Introduction

Most errors aren't serious enough to require the program to stop entirely. Sometimes when a function fails, it's for a reason that you can easily interpret and respond to. For example, if you try to open a file and that operation fails because the file doesn't exist, you might want to create the file instead of terminating the process.

### The `Result` Enum

Recall from ["Handling Potential Failure with `Result`"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#handling-potential-failure-with-result) in Chapter 2 that the `Result` enum is defined as having two variants, `Ok` and `Err`, as follows:

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```
### Generic Type Parameters

The `T` and `E` are generic type parameters. We’ll discuss generics in more detail in Chapter 10. What you need to know right now is that `T` represents the type of the value that will be returned in a success case within the `Ok` variant, and `E` represents the type of the error that will be returned in a failure case within the `Err` variant. Because `Result` has these generic type parameters, we can use the `Result` type and the functions defined on it in many different situations where the success value and error value we want to return may differ.

### Example: Opening a File

Let’s call a function that returns a `Result` value because the function could fail. In Listing 9-3, we try to open a file.

#### Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file_result = File::open("hello.txt");
}
```

#### Listing 9-3: Opening a file

The return type of `File::open` is a `Result<T, E>`. The generic parameter `T` has been filled in by the implementation of `File::open` with the type of the success value, `std::fs::File`, which is a file handle. The type of `E` used in the error value is `std::io::Error`. This return type means the call to `File::open` might succeed and return a file handle that we can read from or write to. The function call also might fail: for example, the file might not exist, or we might not have permission to access the file. The `File::open` function needs to have a way to tell us whether it succeeded or failed and at the same time give us either the file handle or error information. This information is exactly what the `Result` enum conveys.
