## Recoverable Errors with `Result`

### Introduction

Most errors aren't serious enough to require the program to stop entirely. Sometimes when a function fails, it's for a reason that you can easily interpret and respond to. For example, if you try to open a file and that operation fails because the file doesn't exist, you might want to create the file instead of terminating the process.

### The `Result` Enum

Recall from ["Handling Potential Failure with `Result`"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#handling-potential-failure-with-result) in Chapter 2 that the `Result` enum is defined as having two variants, `Ok` and `Err`, as follows:

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```
### Generic Type Parameters

The `T` and `E` are generic type parameters. We'll discuss generics in more detail in Chapter 10. What you need to know right now is that `T` represents the type of the value that will be returned in a success case within the `Ok` variant, and `E` represents the type of the error that will be returned in a failure case within the `Err` variant. Because `Result` has these generic type parameters, we can use the `Result` type and the functions defined on it in many different situations where the success value and error value we want to return may differ.

### Example: Opening a File

Let's call a function that returns a `Result` value because the function could fail. In Listing 9-3, we try to open a file.

#### Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file_result = File::open("hello.txt");
}
```

#### Listing 9-3: Opening a file

The return type of `File::open` is a `Result<T, E>`. The generic parameter `T` has been filled in by the implementation of `File::open` with the type of the success value, `std::fs::File`, which is a file handle. The type of `E` used in the error value is `std::io::Error`. This return type means the call to `File::open` might succeed and return a file handle that we can read from or write to. The function call also might fail: for example, the file might not exist, or we might not have permission to access the file. The `File::open` function needs to have a way to tell us whether it succeeded or failed and at the same time give us either the file handle or error information. This information is exactly what the `Result` enum conveys.

## Handling `Result` with `match`

### Success and Failure Cases

In the case where `File::open` succeeds, the value in the variable `greeting_file_result` will be an instance of `Ok` that contains a file handle. In the case where it fails, the value in `greeting_file_result` will be an instance of `Err` that contains more information about the kind of error that occurred.

### Adding Error Handling

We need to add to the code in Listing 9-3 to take different actions depending on the value `File::open` returns. Listing 9-4 shows one way to handle the `Result` using a basic tool, the `match` expression that we discussed in Chapter 6.

#### Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file_result = File::open("hello.txt");

    let greeting_file = match greeting_file_result {
        Ok(file) => file,
        Err(error) => panic!("Problem opening the file: {error:?}"),
    };
}
```

#### Listing 9-4: Using a `match` expression to handle the `Result` variants that might be returned

### Scope of `Result` Enum

Note that, like the `Option` enum, the `Result` enum and its variants have been brought into scope by the prelude, so we don't need to specify `Result::` before the `Ok` and `Err` variants in the `match` arms.

### Explanation of `match` Expression

When the result is `Ok`, this code will return the inner `file` value out of the `Ok` variant, and we then assign that file handle value to the variable `greeting_file`. After the `match`, we can use the file handle for reading or writing.

The other arm of the `match` handles the case where we get an `Err` value from `File::open`. In this example, we've chosen to call the `panic!` macro. If there's no file named *hello.txt* in our current directory and we run this code, we'll see the following output from the `panic!` macro:

```sh
$ cargo run
   Compiling error-handling v0.1.0 (file:///projects/error-handling)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.73s
     Running `target/debug/error-handling`
thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:8:23:
Problem opening the file: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" }
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

### Output Explanation

As usual, this output tells us exactly what has gone wrong.

## Matching on Different Errors

The code in Listing 9-4 will `panic!` no matter why `File::open` failed. However, we want to take different actions for different failure reasons. If `File::open` failed because the file doesn't exist, we want to create the file and return the handle to the new file. If `File::open` failed for any other reason—for example, because we didn't have permission to open the file—we still want the code to `panic!` in the same way it did in Listing 9-4. For this, we add an inner `match` expression, shown in Listing 9-5.

#### Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::ErrorKind;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file_result = File::open("hello.txt");

    let greeting_file = match greeting_file_result {
        Ok(file) => file,
        Err(error) => match error.kind() {
            ErrorKind::NotFound => match File::create("hello.txt") {
                Ok(fc) => fc,
                Err(e) => panic!("Problem creating the file: {e:?}"),
            },
            other_error => panic!("Problem opening the file: {other_error:?}"),
        },
    };
}
```

#### Listing 9-5: Handling different kinds of errors in different ways

### Error Handling with `io::Error`

The type of the value that `File::open` returns inside the `Err` variant is `io::Error`, which is a struct provided by the standard library. This struct has a method `kind` that we can call to get an `io::ErrorKind` value. The enum `io::ErrorKind` is provided by the standard library and has variants representing the different kinds of errors that might result from an `io` operation. The variant we want to use is `ErrorKind::NotFound`, which indicates the file we're trying to open doesn't exist yet. So we match on `greeting_file_result`, but we also have an inner match on `error.kind()`.

### Inner `match` Expression

The condition we want to check in the inner match is whether the value returned by `error.kind()` is the `NotFound` variant of the `ErrorKind` enum. If it is, we try to create the file with `File::create`. However, because `File::create` could also fail, we need a second arm in the inner `match` expression. When the file can't be created, a different error message is printed. The second arm of the outer `match` stays the same, so the program panics on any error besides the missing file error.

### Matching on Different Errors | Key Points

1. **Different Actions for Different Errors**:
   - Instead of panicking for all errors, handle specific errors differently.
   - For example, if a file doesn't exist, create it; otherwise, panic.

2. **Using `io::Error` and `io::ErrorKind`**:
   - `File::open` returns an `io::Error` inside the `Err` variant.
   - Use the `kind` method on `io::Error` to get an `io::ErrorKind` value.

3. **Matching on `ErrorKind`**:
   - Match on the result of `File::open`.
   - Use an inner `match` to handle specific `ErrorKind` variants.
   - For `ErrorKind::NotFound`, attempt to create the file.
   - For other errors, panic with an appropriate message.

4. **Example Code**:
   - Demonstrates how to use nested `match` expressions to handle different error kinds.

5. **Handling File Creation Errors**:
   - When trying to create a file, handle potential errors from `File::create`.
   - Provide a specific error message if file creation fails.


### Alternatives to Using `match` with `Result<T, E>`

That's a lot of `match`! The `match` expression is very useful but also very much a primitive. In Chapter 13, you'll learn about closures, which are used with many of the methods defined on `Result<T, E>`. These methods can be more concise than using `match` when handling `Result<T, E>` values in your code.

#### Using Closures and `unwrap_or_else`

For example, here's another way to write the same logic as shown in Listing 9-5, this time using closures and the `unwrap_or_else` method:

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::ErrorKind;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file = File::open("hello.txt").unwrap_or_else(|error| {
        if error.kind() == ErrorKind::NotFound {
            File::create("hello.txt").unwrap_or_else(|error| {
                panic!("Problem creating the file: {error:?}");
            })
        } else {
            panic!("Problem opening the file: {error:?}");
        }
    });
}
```

#### Benefits of Using `unwrap_or_else`

Although this code has the same behavior as Listing 9-5, it doesn't contain any `match` expressions and is cleaner to read. 

#### Further Reading

Come back to this example after you've read Chapter 13, and look up the `unwrap_or_else` method in the standard library documentation. Many more of these methods can clean up huge nested `match` expressions when you're dealing with errors.

### Shortcuts for Panic on Error: `unwrap` and `expect`

Using `match` works well enough, but it can be a bit verbose and doesn't always communicate intent well. The `Result<T, E>` type has many helper methods defined on it to do various, more specific tasks.

#### The `unwrap` Method

The `unwrap` method is a shortcut implemented just like the `match` expression we wrote in Listing 9-4. If the `Result` value is the `Ok` variant, `unwrap` will return the value inside the `Ok`. If the `Result` is the `Err` variant, `unwrap` will call the `panic!` macro for us. Here is an example of `unwrap` in action:

#### Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file = File::open("hello.txt").unwrap();
}
```

#### Example Output

If we run this code without a *hello.txt* file, we'll see an error message from the `panic!` call that the `unwrap` method makes:

```sh
thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:4:49:
called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" }
```

#### The `expect` Method

Similarly, the `expect` method lets us also choose the `panic!` error message. Using `expect` instead of `unwrap` and providing good error messages can convey your intent and make tracking down the source of a panic easier. The syntax of `expect` looks like this:

#### Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file = File::open("hello.txt")
        .expect("hello.txt should be included in this project");
}
```

#### Example Output

We use `expect` in the same way as `unwrap`: to return the file handle or call the `panic!` macro. The error message used by `expect` in its call to `panic!` will be the parameter that we pass to `expect`, rather than the default `panic!` message that `unwrap` uses. Here's what it looks like:

```sh
thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:5:10:
hello.txt should be included in this project: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" }
```

#### Best Practices

In production-quality code, most Rustaceans choose `expect` rather than `unwrap` and give more context about why the operation is expected to always succeed. That way, if your assumptions are ever proven wrong, you have more information to use in debugging.

### Propagating Errors

When a function's implementation calls something that might fail, instead of handling the error within the function itself, you can return the error to the calling code so that it can decide what to do. This is known as *propagating* the error and gives more control to the calling code, where there might be more information or logic that dictates how the error should be handled than what you have available in the context of your code.

### Example: Reading a Username from a File

For example, Listing 9-6 shows a function that reads a username from a file. If the file doesn't exist or can't be read, this function will return those errors to the code that called the function.

#### Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    let username_file_result = File::open("hello.txt");

    let mut username_file = match username_file_result {
        Ok(file) => file,
        Err(e) => return Err(e),
    };

    let mut username = String::new();

    match username_file.read_to_string(&mut username) {
        Ok(_) => Ok(username),
        Err(e) => Err(e),
    }
}
```

#### Listing 9-6: A function that returns errors to the calling code using `match`

### Explanation

- **Error Propagation**: Instead of handling errors within the function, return them to the caller.
- **Control to Calling Code**: This approach gives more control to the calling code, which might have more context or logic to handle the error appropriately.
- **Example Function**: The example function attempts to read a username from a file and propagates any errors encountered during file opening or reading.

### Example Breakdown

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    let username_file_result = File::open("hello.txt");

    let mut username_file = match username_file_result {
        Ok(file) => file,
        Err(e) => return Err(e),
    };

    let mut username = String::new();

    match username_file.read_to_string(&mut username) {
        Ok(_) => Ok(username),
        Err(e) => Err(e),
    }
}
```

This function can be written in a much shorter way, but we're going to start by doing a lot of it manually in order to explore error handling. At the end, we'll show the shorter way.

### Return Type

The return type of the function is `Result<String, io::Error>`. This means the function returns a value of the type `Result<T, E>`, where:
- `T` is the concrete type `String`
- `E` is the concrete type `io::Error`

### Success and Error Handling

- **Success**: If the function succeeds, the calling code receives an `Ok` value containing a `String` (the `username` read from the file).
- **Error**: If the function encounters any problems, the calling code receives an `Err` value containing an instance of `io::Error` with more information about the problem.

### Error Type Choice

We chose `io::Error` as the return type because it is the type of the error value returned from both operations in the function that might fail:
- `File::open`
- `read_to_string`

### Function Body

1. **Opening the File**:
   - The function starts by calling `File::open`.
   - The `Result` value is handled with a `match`.
   - If `File::open` succeeds, the file handle is assigned to `username_file`.
   - If `File::open` fails, the function returns early with the error value.

2. **Reading the File**:
   - If the file handle is valid, a new `String` is created in `username`.
   - The `read_to_string` method is called on the file handle to read the contents into `username`.
   - The `Result` from `read_to_string` is handled with another `match`.
   - If `read_to_string` succeeds, the function returns the `username` wrapped in an `Ok`.
   - If `read_to_string` fails, the function returns the error value.

### Handling the Result

The calling code will handle either:
- An `Ok` value containing a username
- An `Err` value containing an `io::Error`

### Calling Code's Responsibility

The calling code decides what to do with the values:
- It could call `panic!` and crash the program.
- Use a default username.
- Look up the username from another source.

### Propagating Errors

This pattern of propagating errors is common in Rust. Rust provides the question mark operator `?` to make this easier.

### A Shortcut for Propagating Errors: the `?` Operator

#### Introduction

Listing 9-7 shows an implementation of `read_username_from_file` that has the same functionality as in Listing 9-6, but this implementation uses the `?` operator.

#### Filename: `src/main.rs`

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    let mut username_file = File::open("hello.txt")?;
    let mut username = String::new();
    username_file.read_to_string(&mut username)?;
    Ok(username)
}
```
*Listing 9-7: A function that returns errors to the calling code using the `?` operator*

#### Explanation of the `?` Operator

- **Functionality**: The `?` operator works similarly to the `match` expressions used to handle `Result` values.
- **Success Case**: If the `Result` is `Ok`, the value inside `Ok` is returned, and the program continues.
- **Error Case**: If the `Result` is `Err`, the `Err` is returned from the function, propagating the error to the calling code.

#### Difference from `match`

- **Conversion**: The `?` operator calls the `from` function from the `From` trait to convert error types.
- **Utility**: This is useful when a function returns one error type to represent multiple failure reasons.

#### Custom Error Type Example

- **Custom Error**: You can define a custom error type, e.g., `OurError`.
- **Conversion Implementation**: Implement `From<io::Error>` for `OurError`.
- **Automatic Conversion**: The `?` operator will convert `io::Error` to `OurError` using the `from` function.

#### Context of Listing 9-7

- **File Opening**: The `?` after `File::open` returns the `Ok` value to `username_file` or propagates the `Err`.
- **Reading File**: The `?` after `read_to_string` does the same for reading the file contents.

#### Simplification

- **Boilerplate Reduction**: The `?` operator reduces boilerplate code.
- **Further Shortening**: Method calls can be chained immediately after the `?`, as shown in Listing 9-8.

### Chaining Method Calls with the `?` Operator

#### Filename: `src/main.rs`
```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    let mut username = String::new();

    File::open("hello.txt")?.read_to_string(&mut username)?;

    Ok(username)
}
```
*Listing 9-8: Chaining method calls after the `?` operator*

#### Explanation

- **String Initialization**: The creation of the new `String` in `username` is moved to the beginning of the function.
- **Chaining Calls**: Instead of creating a variable `username_file`, the call to `read_to_string` is chained directly onto the result of `File::open("hello.txt")?`.
- **Error Handling**: The `?` operator is used at the end of the `read_to_string` call to propagate any errors.
- **Return Value**: The function returns an `Ok` value containing `username` when both `File::open` and `read_to_string` succeed.

#### Functionality

- The functionality remains the same as in Listings 9-6 and 9-7.
- This approach is more ergonomic and concise.

### Using `fs::read_to_string`

#### Filename: `src/main.rs`

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::io;

fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    fs::read_to_string("hello.txt")
}
```
*Listing 9-9: Using `fs::read_to_string` instead of opening and then reading the file*

#### Explanation

- **Convenience**: The standard library provides the `fs::read_to_string` function for reading a file into a string.
- **Functionality**: This function opens the file, creates a new `String`, reads the contents into the `String`, and returns it.
- **Simplification**: Using `fs::read_to_string` simplifies the code further by eliminating the need to manually handle file opening and reading.

#### Summary

- **Error Handling**: The `?` operator simplifies error propagation.
- **Ergonomics**: Chaining method calls and using `fs::read_to_string` make the code more concise and readable.
- **Educational Value**: The longer approach was used initially to explain error handling in detail.

### Where The `?` Operator Can Be Used

#### Compatibility Requirement

- **Return Type**: The `?` operator can only be used in functions whose return type is compatible with the value the `?` is used on.
- **Early Return**: The `?` operator performs an early return of a value out of the function, similar to a `match` expression.

#### Example from Listing 9-6

- **Result Handling**: In Listing 9-6, the `match` expression handled a `Result` value, returning an `Err(e)` for errors.
- **Function Return Type**: The function's return type must be a `Result` to be compatible with the `?` operator.

#### Incompatible Return Type Example

- **Error Demonstration**: Listing 9-10 shows the error when using the `?` operator in a `main` function with an incompatible return type.

#### Filename: `src/main.rs`

```rust,ignore,does_not_compile
use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file = File::open("hello.txt")?;
}
```

*Listing 9-10: Attempting to use the `?` in the `main` function that returns `()` won't compile.*

### Opening a File with Potential Failure

```rust,ignore,does_not_compile
use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file = File::open("hello.txt")?;
}
```

*Listing 9-10: Attempting to use the `?` in the `main` function that returns `()` won't compile.*

This code opens a file, which might fail. The `?` operator follows the `Result` value returned by `File::open`, but this `main` function has the return type of `()`, not `Result`.

### Error Message

When we compile this code, we get the following error message:

```sh
$ cargo run
   Compiling error-handling v0.1.0 (file:///projects/error-handling)

```

### Explanation

This error points out that we're only allowed to use the `?` operator in a function that returns `Result`, `Option`, or another type that implements `FromResidual`.

### Fixing the Error

To fix the error, you have two choices:
1. **Change the Return Type**: Change the return type of your function to be compatible with the value you're using the `?` operator on, as long as you have no restrictions preventing that.
2. **Handle the `Result` Manually**: Use a `match` or one of the `Result<T, E>` methods to handle the `Result<T, E>` in whatever way is appropriate.

### Using `?` with `Option<T>`

The error message also mentioned that `?` can be used with `Option<T>` values as well. As with using `?` on `Result`, you can only use `?` on `Option` in a function that returns an `Option`.

The behavior of the `?` operator when called on an `Option<T>` is similar to its behavior when called on a `Result<T, E>`: if the value is `None`, the `None` will be returned early from the function at that point. If the value is `Some`, the value inside the `Some` is the resultant value of the expression, and the function continues.

### Example

Listing 9-11 has an example of a function that finds the last character of the first line in the given text.

```rust
fn last_char_of_first_line(text: &str) -> Option<char> {
    text.lines().next()?.chars().last()
}
```

<span class="caption">Listing 9-11: Using the `?` operator on an `Option<T>` value</span>

### Explanation

This function returns `Option<char>` because it's possible that there is a character there, but it's also possible that there isn't. This code takes the `text` string slice argument and calls the `lines` method on it, which returns an iterator over the lines in the string. Because this function wants to examine the first line, it calls `next` on the iterator to get the first value from the iterator. 

- **Empty String Case**: If `text` is the empty string, this call to `next` will return `None`, in which case we use `?` to stop and return `None` from `last_char_of_first_line`.
- **Non-Empty String Case**: If `text` is not the empty string, `next` will return a `Some` value containing a string slice of the first line in `text`.

### Using the `?` Operator

The `?` extracts the string slice, and we can call `chars` on that string slice to get an iterator of its characters. We're interested in the last character in this first line, so we call `last` to return the last item in the iterator. This is an `Option` because it's possible that the first line is the empty string; for example, if `text` starts with a blank line but has characters on other lines, as in `"\nhi"`. However, if there is a last character on the first line, it will be returned in the `Some` variant. 

The `?` operator in the middle gives us a concise way to express this logic, allowing us to implement the function in one line. If we couldn't use the `?` operator on `Option`, we'd have to implement this logic using more method calls or a `match` expression.

The logic being referred to is the sequence of steps needed to handle potential `None` values when working with `Option<T>` types. Specifically, it involves:

1. **Extracting the First Line**: Using `text.lines().next()` to get the first line of the text. If the text is empty, this returns `None`.
2. **Handling `None` Early**: The `?` operator checks if the result is `None`. If it is, the function returns `None` immediately.
3. **Continuing with `Some`**: If the result is `Some`, the `?` operator extracts the value inside the `Some` and continues with the next step.
4. **Getting the Last Character**: Calling `chars().last()` on the extracted line to get the last character, which is also an `Option`.

By using the `?` operator, these steps are handled concisely in one line, without needing additional `match` statements or method calls to manually check and handle `None` values at each step. This makes the code more readable and succinct.

### Important Note

You can use the `?` operator on a `Result` in a function that returns `Result`, and you can use the `?` operator on an `Option` in a function that returns `Option`, but you can't mix and match. The `?` operator won't automatically convert a `Result` to an `Option` or vice versa; in those cases, you can use methods like the `ok` method on `Result` or the `ok_or` method on `Option` to do the conversion explicitly.

### Special Nature of `main` Function

So far, all the `main` functions we've used return `()`. The `main` function is special because it's the entry point and exit point of an executable program, and there are restrictions on what its return type can be for the program to behave as expected.

### Returning `Result<(), E>` from `main`

Luckily, `main` can also return a `Result<(), E>`. Listing 9-12 has the code from Listing 9-10, but we've changed the return type of `main` to be `Result<(), Box<dyn Error>>` and added a return value `Ok(())` to the end. This code will now compile.

<span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span>

```rust
use std::error::Error;
use std::fs::File;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    let greeting_file = File::open("hello.txt")?;

    Ok(())

### Understanding `Box<dyn Error>`

The `Box<dyn Error>` type is a *trait object*, which we'll talk about in the ["Using Trait Objects that Allow for Values of Different Types"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch17-02-trait-objects.html#using-trait-objects-that-allow-for-values-of-different-types) section in Chapter 17. For now, you can read `Box<dyn Error>` to mean "any kind of error." Using `?` on a `Result` value in a `main` function with the error type `Box<dyn Error>` is allowed because it allows any `Err` value to be returned early. Even though the body of this `main` function will only ever return errors of type `std::io::Error`, by specifying `Box<dyn Error>`, this signature will continue to be correct even if more code that returns other errors is added to the body of `main`.

### What is `Box<dyn Error>`?

`Box<dyn Error>` is a way to handle errors in Rust using dynamic dispatch. Here's a breakdown of the components:

- **`Box`**: This is a smart pointer that allocates data on the heap. It allows you to store data that has a size unknown at compile time or data that is too large to store on the stack.
- **`dyn`**: This keyword stands for "dynamic" and is used to indicate that we are working with a trait object. A trait object allows for dynamic dispatch, meaning the exact type that implements the trait is determined at runtime.
- **`Error`**: This is a trait provided by the standard library that represents the basic expectations for error values, such as the ability to display an error message.

### Why Use `Box<dyn Error>`?

1. **Flexibility**: `Box<dyn Error>` allows you to return different types of errors from a function. Since `Box<dyn Error>` can represent any error type that implements the `Error` trait, it provides a flexible way to handle various error types without specifying them explicitly.

2. **Dynamic Dispatch**: By using `dyn`, you enable dynamic dispatch, which means the exact type of the error is determined at runtime. This is useful when you want to handle multiple error types in a uniform way.

3. **Heap Allocation**: Using `Box` means the error is stored on the heap, which can be beneficial for large error types or when the size of the error type is not known at compile time.



### Trait Objects and `Box<dyn Error>`

The `Box<dyn Error>` type is a trait object. A trait object is a way to use traits as types. It allows for dynamic dispatch, meaning the method to call is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object. This is different from static dispatch, where the method to call is determined at compile time.
