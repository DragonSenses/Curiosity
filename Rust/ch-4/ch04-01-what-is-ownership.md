# Understanding Ownership

1. **Ownership:**
   - Rust's most unique feature.
   - Enables memory safety guarantees without a garbage collector.
   - Crucial for understanding Rust's behavior.

2. **Related Features:**
   - **Borrowing:** Allows temporary access to data without transferring ownership.
   - **Slices:** Subsets of data (e.g., array slices) that don't own the underlying memory.
   - **Memory Layout:** How Rust organizes data in memory.

Ownership is Rust's most unique feature and has deep implications for the rest of the language. It enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector, so it's important to understand how ownership works. In this chapter, we'll talk about ownership as well as several related features: borrowing, slices, and how Rust lays data out in memory.
