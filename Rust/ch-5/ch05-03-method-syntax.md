## Method Syntax

*Methods* are similar to functions: we declare them with the `fn` keyword and a name, they can have parameters and a return value, and they contain some code thatâ€™s run when the method is called from somewhere else. Unlike functions, methods are defined within the context of a struct (or an enum or a trait object, which we cover in [Chapter 6](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch06-00-enums.html) and [Chapter 17](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch17-02-trait-objects.html), respectively), and their first parameter is always `self`, which represents the instance of the struct the method is being called on.
