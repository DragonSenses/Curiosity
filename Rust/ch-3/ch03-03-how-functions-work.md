## Functions

Functions are prevalent in Rust code. You've already seen one of the most important functions in the language: the `main` function, which is the entry point of many programs. You've also seen the `fn` keyword, which allows you to declare new functions.

Rust code uses *snake case* as the conventional style for function and variable names, in which all letters are lowercase and underscores separate words. Here's a program that contains an example function definition:

**Filename**: `src/main.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");

    another_function();
}

fn another_function() {
    println!("Another function.");
}
```

We define a function in Rust by entering `fn` followed by a function name and a set of parentheses. The curly brackets tell the compiler where the function body begins and ends.

We can call any function we've defined by entering its name followed by a set of parentheses. Because `another_function` is defined in the program, it can be called from inside the `main` function. Note that we defined `another_function` *after* the `main` function in the source code; we could have defined it before
as well. Rust doesn't care where you define your functions, only that they're defined somewhere in a scope that can be seen by the caller.

- Rust doesn't impose strict ordering of function definitions; you can define functions in any order as long as they're visible within their scope. In this case, `another_function` is defined after `main`, but it could have been defined before as well.

**Example:** Let’s start a new binary project named *functions* to explore functions further. Place the `another_function` example in *src/main.rs* and run it. You should see the following output:

```console
$ cargo run
   Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.28s
     Running `target/debug/functions`
Hello, world!
Another function.
```

The lines execute in the order in which they appear in the `main` function. First the “Hello, world!” message prints, and then `another_function` is called and its message is printed.
