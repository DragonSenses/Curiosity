## Control Flow

The ability to run some code depending on whether a condition is `true` and to run some code repeatedly while a condition is `true` are basic building blocks in most programming languages. The most common constructs that let you control the flow of execution of Rust code are `if` expressions and loops.

### `if` Expressions

An `if` expression allows you to branch your code depending on conditions. You provide a condition and then state, “If this condition is met, run this block of code. If the condition is not met, do not run this block of code.”

Create a new project called *branches* in your *projects* directory to explore the `if` expression. In the *src/main.rs* file, input the following:

**Filename**: `src/main.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}
```

All `if` expressions start with the keyword `if`, followed by a condition. In this case, the condition checks whether or not the variable `number` has a value less than 5. We place the block of code to execute if the condition is `true` immediately after the condition inside curly brackets.  Blocks of code associated with the conditions in `if` expressions are sometimes called *arms*, just like the arms in `match` expressions.

Optionally, we can also include an `else` expression, which we chose to do here, to give the program an alternative block of code to execute should the condition evaluate to `false`. If you don't provide an `else` expression and the condition is `false`, the program will just skip the `if` block and move on to the next bit of code.

Try running this code; you should see the following output:

```sh
$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
     Running `target/debug/branches`
condition was true
```

Let's try changing the value of `number` to a value that makes the condition `false` to see what happens:

```rust,ignore
    let number = 7;
```

Run the program again, and look at the output:

```sh
$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
     Running `target/debug/branches`
condition was false
```

#### if conditions must be a `bool`

1. **Condition in `if` Expressions:**
   - The condition in an `if` expression **must** be a `bool`.
   - If it isn't a `bool`, Rust will throw an error.
   - Example:

     ```rust
     fn main() {
         let condition = 3; // Not a boolean value
         if condition {
             println!("This won't compile");
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Explicit Boolean Conditions:**
   - Unlike some other languages, Rust does not automatically convert non-Boolean types to a Boolean.
   - We must explicitly provide a `bool` as the condition for the `if` expression.
   - Example:

     ```rust
     fn main() {
         let number = 42;
         if number != 0 {
             println!("number was something other than zero");
         }
     }
     ```

   - Running this modified code will print the message "number was something other than zero." 

It's also worth noting that the condition in this code *must* be a `bool`. If the condition isn't a `bool`, we'll get an error. For example, try running the following code:

**Filename**: `src/main.rs`

```rust,ignore,does_not_compile
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number {
        println!("number was three");
    }
}
```

The `if` condition evaluates to a value of `3` this time, and Rust throws an error:

```sh
$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:4:8
  |
4 |     if number {
  |        ^^^^^^ expected `bool`, found integer

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0308`.
error: could not compile `branches` (bin "branches") due to 1 previous error
```

The error indicates that Rust expected a `bool` but got an integer. Unlike languages such as Ruby and JavaScript, Rust will not automatically try to convert non-Boolean types to a Boolean. You must be explicit and always provide `if` with a Boolean as its condition. If we want the `if` code block to run only when a number is not equal to `0`, for example, we can change the `if` expression to the following:

**Filename**: `src/main.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number != 0 {
        println!("number was something other than zero");
    }
}
```

Running this code will print `number was something other than zero`.

#### Handling Multiple Conditions with `else if`

You can use multiple conditions by combining `if` and `else` in an `else if` expression. For example:

**Filename**: `src/main.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}
```

This program has four possible paths it can take. After running it, you should see the following output:

```sh
$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
     Running `target/debug/branches`
number is divisible by 3
```

When this program executes, it checks each `if` expression in turn and executes the first body for which the condition evaluates to `true`. Note that even though 6 is divisible by 2, we don't see the output `number is divisible by 2`, nor do we see the `number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2` text from the `else` block. That's because Rust only executes the block for the first `true` condition, and once it finds one, it doesn't even check the rest.

Using too many `else if` expressions can clutter your code, so if you have more than one, you might want to refactor your code. Chapter 6 describes a powerful Rust branching construct called `match` for these cases.

#### Using `if` in a `let` Statement

Because `if` is an expression, we can use it on the right side of a `let` statement to assign the outcome to a variable, as in Listing 3-2.

**Listing 3-2**: Assigning the result of an if expression to a variable

**Filename**: `src/main.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };

    println!("The value of number is: {number}");
}
```

The `number` variable will be bound to a value based on the outcome of the `if` expression. Run this code to see what happens:

```sh
$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.30s
     Running `target/debug/branches`
The value of number is: 5
```

Remember that blocks of code evaluate to the last expression in them, and numbers by themselves are also expressions. In this case, the value of the whole `if` expression depends on which block of code executes. This means the values that have the potential to be results from each arm of the `if` must be the same type; in Listing 3-2, the results of both the `if` arm and the `else` arm were `i32` integers. If the types are mismatched, as in the following example, we'll get an error:

**Filename**: `src/main.rs`

```rust,ignore,does_not_compile
fn main() {
    let condition = true;

    let number = if condition { 5 } else { "six" };

    println!("The value of number is: {number}");
}
```

When we try to compile this code, we'll get an error. The `if` and `else` arms have value types that are incompatible, and Rust indicates exactly where to find the problem in the program:

```sh
$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
error[E0308]: `if` and `else` have incompatible types
 --> src/main.rs:4:44
  |
4 |     let number = if condition { 5 } else { "six" };
  |                                 -          ^^^^^ expected integer, found `&str`
  |                                 |
  |                                 expected because of this

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0308`.
error: could not compile `branches` (bin "branches") due to 1 previous error
```

The expression in the `if` block evaluates to an integer, and the expression in the `else` block evaluates to a string. This won't work because variables must have a single type, and Rust needs to know at compile time what type the `number` variable is, definitively. Knowing the type of `number` lets the compiler verify the type is valid everywhere we use `number`. Rust wouldn't be able to do that if the type of `number` was only determined at runtime; the compiler would be more complex and would make fewer guarantees about the code if it had to keep track of multiple hypothetical types for any variable.
