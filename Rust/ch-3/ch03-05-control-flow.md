## Control Flow

The ability to run some code depending on whether a condition is `true` and to run some code repeatedly while a condition is `true` are basic building blocks in most programming languages. The most common constructs that let you control the flow of execution of Rust code are `if` expressions and loops.

### `if` Expressions

An `if` expression allows you to branch your code depending on conditions. You provide a condition and then state, “If this condition is met, run this block of code. If the condition is not met, do not run this block of code.”

Create a new project called *branches* in your *projects* directory to explore the `if` expression. In the *src/main.rs* file, input the following:

**Filename**: `src/main.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}
```

All `if` expressions start with the keyword `if`, followed by a condition. In this case, the condition checks whether or not the variable `number` has a value less than 5. We place the block of code to execute if the condition is `true` immediately after the condition inside curly brackets.  Blocks of code associated with the conditions in `if` expressions are sometimes called *arms*, just like the arms in `match` expressions.

Optionally, we can also include an `else` expression, which we chose to do here, to give the program an alternative block of code to execute should the condition evaluate to `false`. If you don't provide an `else` expression and the condition is `false`, the program will just skip the `if` block and move on to the next bit of code.

Try running this code; you should see the following output:

```sh
$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
     Running `target/debug/branches`
condition was true
```

Let's try changing the value of `number` to a value that makes the condition `false` to see what happens:

```rust,ignore
    let number = 7;
```

Run the program again, and look at the output:

```sh
$ cargo run
   Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
     Running `target/debug/branches`
condition was false
```
