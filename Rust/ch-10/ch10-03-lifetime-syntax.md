## Validating References with Lifetimes

### Overview
Lifetimes are a kind of generic we've been using. Unlike ensuring a type has the desired behavior, lifetimes ensure references are valid for as long as needed.

#### References and Borrowing
Every reference in Rust has a *lifetime*, defining the scope for which the reference is valid. This concept was touched on in Chapter 4's ["References and Borrowing"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-02-references-and-borrowing.html#references-and-borrowing) section.

#### Implicit and Inferred Lifetimes
Most of the time, lifetimes are implicit and inferred, similar to how types are inferred. Annotation is required only when multiple types or lifetimes could be related in different ways.

#### Annotating Lifetimes
Rust requires annotation of relationships using generic lifetime parameters to ensure the actual references used at runtime will be valid.

#### Unfamiliar Concept
Annotating lifetimes is unfamiliar to most programming languages. While this chapter won't cover lifetimes in their entirety, common lifetime syntax will be discussed to get comfortable with the concept.

#### Conclusion
Understanding and using lifetimes ensures the safety and validity of references in Rust, helping prevent issues at runtime.

### Preventing Dangling References with Lifetimes

#### Overview
The main aim of lifetimes is to prevent *dangling references*, which cause a program to reference data other than the data it's intended to reference.

#### Example: Dangling Reference
Consider the program in Listing 10-16, which has an outer scope and an inner scope.

```rust,ignore,does_not_compile
fn main() {
    let r;

    {
        let x = 5;
        r = &x;
    }

    println!("r: {r}");
}
```

**Listing 10-16**: An attempt to use a reference whose value has gone out of scope.

**Note**: The examples in Listing 10-16, 10-17, and 10-23 declare variables without giving them an initial value, so the variable name exists in the outer scope. At first glance, this might appear to be in conflict with Rust's having no null values. However, if we try to use a variable before giving it a value, we'll get a compile-time error, which shows that Rust indeed does not allow null values.

#### Explanation
In the outer scope, a variable named `r` is declared without an initial value. In the inner scope, a variable named `x` with the initial value of `5` is declared. Inside the inner scope, we attempt to set `r` as a reference to `x`. When the inner scope ends, `x` goes out of scope, but `r` is still valid in the outer scope.
