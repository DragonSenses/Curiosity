## Generic Data Types

We use generics to create definitions for items like function signatures or structs, which we can then use with many different concrete data types. Let's first look at how to define functions, structs, enums, and methods using generics. Then we'll discuss how generics affect code performance.

### In Function Definitions

When defining a function that uses generics, we place the generics in the signature of the function where we would usually specify the data types of the parameters and return value. Doing so makes our code more flexible and provides more functionality to callers of our function while preventing code duplication.

Continuing with our `largest` function, Listing 10-4 shows two functions that both find the largest value in a slice. We'll then combine these into a single function that uses generics.

#### Example: src/main.rs

```rust
fn largest_i32(list: &[i32]) -> &i32 {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn largest_char(list: &[char]) -> &char {
    let mut largest = &list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item;
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let result = largest_i32(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {result}");

    let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];

    let result = largest_char(&char_list);
    println!("The largest char is {result}");
}
```

### Eliminate Duplication with Generics

The `largest_i32` function is the one we extracted in Listing 10-3 that finds the largest `i32` in a slice. The `largest_char` function finds the largest `char` in a slice. The function bodies have the same code, so let's eliminate the duplication by introducing a generic type parameter in a single function.

To parameterize the types in a new single function, we need to name the type parameter, just as we do for the value parameters to a function. You can use any identifier as a type parameter name. But we'll use `T` because, by convention, type parameter names in Rust are short, often just one letter, and Rust's type-naming convention is UpperCamelCase. Short for *type*, `T` is the default choice of most Rust programmers.

### Declaring Type Parameters in Function Signatures

When we use a parameter in the body of the function, we have to declare the parameter name in the signature so the compiler knows what that name means. Similarly, when we use a type parameter name in a function signature, we have to declare the type parameter name before we use it.

To define the generic `largest` function, we place type name declarations inside angle brackets, `<>`, between the name of the function and the parameter list, like this:

```rust, ignore
fn largest<T>(list: &[T]) -> &T {
```

We read this definition as: the function `largest` is generic over some type `T`. This function has one parameter named `list`, which is a slice of values of type `T`. The `largest` function will return a reference to a value of the same type `T`.
