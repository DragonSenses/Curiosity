## Bringing Paths into Scope with the `use` Keyword

Having to write out the paths to call functions can feel inconvenient and repetitive. In Listing 7-7, whether we chose the absolute or relative path to the `add_to_waitlist` function, every time we wanted to call `add_to_waitlist` we had to specify `front_of_house` and `hosting` too. Fortunately, thereâ€™s a way to simplify this process: we can create a shortcut to a path with the `use` keyword once, and then use the shorter name everywhere else in the scope.
