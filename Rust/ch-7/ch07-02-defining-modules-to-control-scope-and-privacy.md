## Defining Modules to Control Scope and Privacy

- **Modules**:
  - Organize code into logical units.
  - Encapsulate related functionality.
- **Paths**:
  - Allow you to name items (functions, structs, etc.).
- **`use` keyword**:
  - Brings a path into scope for easier access.
- **`pub` keyword**:
  - Makes items public (visible outside the module).
- Other topics include:
  - **`as` keyword**
  - **External packages**
  - **Glob operator**
