## Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree

To show Rust where to find an item in a module tree, we use a path in the same way we use a path when navigating a filesystem. To call a function, we need to know its path.

A path can take two forms:

* An *absolute path* is the full path starting from a crate root; for code from an external crate, the absolute path begins with the crate name, and for code from the current crate, it starts with the literal `crate`.
* A *relative path* starts from the current module and uses `self`, `super`, or an identifier in the current module.

Both absolute and relative paths are followed by one or more identifiers separated by double colons (`::`).

### Example: `front_of_house` module

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    mod hosting {
        fn add_to_waitlist() {}
        fn seat_at_table() {}
    }

    mod serving {
        fn take_order() {}
        fn serve_order() {}
        fn take_payment() {}
    }
}
```

Returning to Listing 7-1, say we want to call the `add_to_waitlist` function. This is the same as asking: what's the path of the `add_to_waitlist` function? Listing 7-3 contains Listing 7-1 with some of the modules and functions removed.

We'll show two ways to call the `add_to_waitlist` function from a new function, `eat_at_restaurant`, defined in the crate root. These paths are correct, but there's another problem remaining that will prevent this example from compiling as is. We'll explain why in a bit.

The `eat_at_restaurant` function is part of our library crate's public API, so we mark it with the `pub` keyword. In the [“Exposing Paths with the `pub` Keyword”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-03-paths-for-referring-to-an-item-in-the-module-tree.html#exposing-paths-with-the-pub-keyword) section, we'll go into more detail about `pub`.

<span class="filename">Filename: src/lib.rs</span>

```rust,ignore,does_not_compile
mod front_of_house {
    mod hosting {
        fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    // Absolute path
    crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();

    // Relative path
    front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

<span class="caption">Listing 7-3: Calling the `add_to_waitlist` function using absolute and relative paths</span>

The first time we call the `add_to_waitlist` function in `eat_at_restaurant`, we use an absolute path. The `add_to_waitlist` function is defined in the same crate as `eat_at_restaurant`, which means we can use the `crate` keyword to start an absolute path. We then include each of the successive modules until we make our way to `add_to_waitlist`. You can imagine a filesystem with the same structure: we'd specify the path `/front_of_house/hosting/add_to_waitlist` to run the `add_to_waitlist` program; using the `crate` name to start from the crate root is like using `/` to start from the filesystem root in your shell.

The second time we call `add_to_waitlist` in `eat_at_restaurant`, we use a relative path. The path starts with `front_of_house`, the name of the module defined at the same level of the module tree as `eat_at_restaurant`. Here the filesystem equivalent would be using the path `front_of_house/hosting/add_to_waitlist`. Starting with a module name means that the path is relative.

**Choosing whether to use a relative or absolute path is a decision you'll make based on your project, and it depends on whether you're more likely to move item definition code separately from or together with the code that uses the item.** For example, if we moved the `front_of_house` module and the `eat_at_restaurant` function into a module named `customer_experience`, we'd need to update the absolute path to `add_to_waitlist`, but the relative path would still be valid. However, if we moved the `eat_at_restaurant` function separately into a module named `dining`, the absolute path to the `add_to_waitlist` call would stay the same, but the relative path would need to be updated. Our preference in general is to specify absolute paths because it's more likely we'll want to move code definitions and item calls independently of each other.

Let's try to compile Listing 7-3 and find out why it won't compile yet! The errors we get are shown in Listing 7-4.

<span class="caption">Listing 7-4: Compiler errors from building the code in Listing 7-3</span>

The error messages say that module `hosting` is private. In other words, we have the correct paths for the `hosting` module and the `add_to_waitlist` function, but Rust won't let us use them because it doesn't have access to the private sections. In Rust, all items (functions, methods, structs, enums, modules, and constants) are private to parent modules by default. If you want to make an item like a function or struct private, you put it in a module.

Items in a parent module can't use the private items inside child modules, but items in child modules can use the items in their ancestor modules. This is because child modules wrap and hide their implementation details, but the child modules can see the context in which they're defined. To continue with our metaphor, think of the privacy rules as being like the back office of a restaurant: what goes on in there is private to restaurant customers, but office managers can see and do everything in the restaurant they operate.

Rust chose to have the module system function this way so that hiding inner implementation details is the default. That way, you know which parts of the inner code you can change without breaking outer code. However, Rust does give you the option to expose inner parts of child modules' code to outer ancestor modules by using the `pub` keyword to make an item public.
