## Storing Lists of Values with Vectors

- The first collection type is `Vec<T>`, also known as a *vector*.
- Vectors allow you to store multiple values in a single data structure.
- All values in a vector are stored next to each other in memory.
- Vectors can only store values of the same type.
- They are useful for lists of items, such as:
  - Lines of text in a file.
  - Prices of items in a shopping cart.
