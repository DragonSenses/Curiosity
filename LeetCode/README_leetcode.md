# Why?

I wanted to collect a set of programming problems because it stimulates my interest and awakens my curiosity. It also helps me hone my analytical, problem-solving skills. It also helps refresh my knowledge on topics such as data structures and algorithms. It helps me articulate my thought process and approaches to problems, while helping me identify errors or reasonings. Most importantly, it helps me able to abstract away the details to simplify large concepts which leads to greater understanding.

- *To abstract (away)*, specifically in computer science, refers to intentionally obscuring the details of how something works in order to simplify things conceptually.
- Abstract thinking is a cognitive process that allows us to think beyond observable information and deal with concepts, ideas, theories, and principles. By thinking outside of our existing knowledge, we can come up with solutions that aren't immediately obvious. [Source: able.ac](https://able.ac/blog/what-is-abstract-thinking/)
- Abstraction is a process wherein general rules and concepts are derived from the usage and classification of specific examples, literal signifiers, first principles, or other methods. [Abstraction | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction)

What is LeetCode?

- **LeetCode** is a tech skills and interview preparation platform students, professional programmers, and employers use to learn, practice, and assess coding and programming skills.

**LeetCode** is a valuable resource for enhancing your coding skills and preparing for technical interviews. It provides a platform where you can practice solving algorithmic problems, improve your problem-solving abilities, and gain familiarity with common coding patterns. Here are some aspects to consider:

1. **Problem Solving**: LeetCode offers a wide range of coding challenges categorized by difficulty level. By solving these problems, you can sharpen your analytical thinking and algorithmic skills.

2. **Interview Preparation**: Many tech companies use similar problem-solving formats during technical interviews. LeetCode helps you become comfortable with these types of questions, making you better prepared for real-world interviews.

3. **Data Structures and Algorithms**: LeetCode covers various data structures (such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs) and algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming). Mastering these concepts is crucial for technical roles.

4. **Job Readiness**: While LeetCode is an excellent tool for interview preparation, it's essential to complement it with other skills. Understanding system design, databases, and software engineering principles is equally important.

5. **Real Interview Questions**: LeetCode often features real interview questions that have been asked by tech companies. Solving these gives you a taste of what to expect during interviews.

Remember that LeetCode alone doesn't guarantee job readiness. It's part of a broader learning process. Combine it with practical projects, open-source contributions, and soft skills to enhance your overall job readiness.
