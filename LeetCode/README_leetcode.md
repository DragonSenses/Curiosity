# Why?

I wanted to collect a set of programming problems because it stimulates my interest and awakens my curiosity. It also helps me hone my analytical, problem-solving skills. It also helps refresh my knowledge on topics such as data structures and algorithms. It helps me articulate my thought process and approaches to problems, while helping me identify errors or reasonings. Most importantly, it helps me able to abstract away the details to simplify large concepts which leads to greater understanding.

- *To abstract (away)*, specifically in computer science, refers to intentionally obscuring the details of how something works in order to simplify things conceptually.
- Abstract thinking is a cognitive process that allows us to think beyond observable information and deal with concepts, ideas, theories, and principles. By thinking outside of our existing knowledge, we can come up with solutions that aren't immediately obvious. [Source: able.ac](https://able.ac/blog/what-is-abstract-thinking/)
- Abstraction is a process wherein general rules and concepts are derived from the usage and classification of specific examples, literal signifiers, first principles, or other methods. [Abstraction | Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction)
