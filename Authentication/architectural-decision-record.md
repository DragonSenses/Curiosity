# Authentication

Goal: Strengthen my understanding of authentication

As of writing in Jan. 2024, I've had experience with authentication with both self-hosting and authentication providers. [See specifics on authentication experiences below](#authentication-experiences).

I want to dedicate this section for learning more. Here's a list of I want to cover:

- [Auth.js](https://authjs.dev/) with Next.js
- [passport.js](https://www.passportjs.org/), simple, unobtrusive authentication for Node.js
  - [Passportjs | Better Documentation](https://github.com/jwalton/passport-api-docs)
- 

## My Authentication Experiences

I've had experience with both self-Hosting and using authentication providers.

For building authentication for self-hosting and from the ground-up, I covered these levels of security:

1. Basic Account creation (username/password)
2. Database encryption
3. Hashing passwords
4. Salting/Hashing passwords
5. Cookies, JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and Sessions
6. OAuth, social sign-on (SSO)

## Self Hosting

### Job Tracking App
  - JWT, JSON Web tokens
  - Basic account creation with username, email & password
  - hashing passwords with bcrypt
  - using a Bearer Token
  - Testing with Postman
  - Salting/Hashing passwords
  - Database encryption
  
## Authentication Providers

### complete-ecommerce-store

  - [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) for authentication and user management on Next.js
  - Social Sign-On (SSO) for high conversion
  - Creating Webhook endpoints
  - Multifactor Authentication
  - Best practices for `<SignIn/>` and `<UserProfile/>` components

# Developing an App with authentication as the main learning focus

Going to be building an app that will gradually gain more layers of security as we go. Some design decisions will favor neuroplasticity (i.e., learning new things) and ease of building such as using EJS (a templating language with HTML markup with plain JS) over React.
